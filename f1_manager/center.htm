                green light was given signalling the start of the
                2001 season. Most the drivers left their garages
                immediately and performed one shake-down lap of
                their cars. Newcomer to the F1 grid, Enrique
                Bernoldi was the first man out in the Arrows
                followed by Jenson Button, Michael Schumacher and

                size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>David Coulthard
                took to the track after 20 minutes of the session
                had passed and the Scot set the fastest time of
                the session that far with a 1m31.8s lap.
                Coulthard&#146;s top time did not stand for long,
                though, as Michael Schumacher was out on track
                ready to take the top spot for himself.
                Schumacher carved his time down to 1m30.7s as
                Mika Hakkinen set the second fastest time some
                0.8s slower than the Ferrari.<br>
                <br>
                Michael Schumacher&#146;s team mate, Rubens
                Barrichello took to the track after 25 minutes
                and set the fastest time, only to have Schumacher
                snatch the top-spot back by setting a lap of
                1m30.4s. Half way into the one-hour session
                Ferrari dominates. Michael Schumacher led Rubens
                Barrichello, Mika Hakkinen, David Coulthard,
                Heinz Harald Frentzen and Eddie Irvine. With half
                the session gone Fisichella, Button and Trulli
                were yet to set a lap time. <br>
                <br>
                While Jordan mechanics worked on Jarno Trulli&#146;s
                EJ11 Jenson Button and Giancarlo Fisichella took
                to the track in their Benetton B201s. Fisichella
                set the 12th fastest time on his first outing,
                while Button was left down in 17th. Meanwhile
                there was a change at the front &#150; McLaren&#146;s
                Mika Hakkinen bounced back to set the new fastest
                time of 1m30.081s 0.3s faster than Michael
                Schumacher. <br>
                <br>
                While the old hands tussled at the front, Minardi&#146;s
                Fernando Alonso improved his time to climb to
                14th in the timing sheets while BMW Williams
                driver Ralf Schumacher moved up to tenth. Team
                mate Juan Pablo Montoya improved his time also
                and lay seventh, 0.4s ahead of the German. Ralf
                Schumacher meanwhile had a nervous moment as he
                locked up the wheels of his FW23 and almost hit a
                tyre wall. Fortunately he recovered to the race
                track. <br>
                <br>
                With twenty minutes of the session remaining Mika
                Hakkinen led Michael Schumacher, Rubens
                Barrichello, David Coulthard, Jos Verstappen and
                Nick Heidfeld. Heidfeld&#146;s team mate, Kimi
                Raikkonen lay 14th. Meanwhile Olivier Panis was
                back on track an looked like he was on a mission
                as he jumped up to sixth while Michael Schumacher
                also improved on his time to nudge ahead of Mika
                Hakkinen by less than 0.1s. Schumacher continued
                to lap and broke into the 1m20s laps with a
                fantastic time of 1m29.7s. <br>
                <br>
                With ten minutes of the session remaining Michael
                Schumacher led Mika Hakkinen by 0.3s. Rubens
                Barrichello was holding onto third with Coulthard
                fourth ahead of Frentzen and Panis. Kimi
                Raikkonen was up to tenth ahead of Juan Pablo
                Montoya in eleventh. The Benettons were
                struggling with Button and Fisichella in 15th and
                16th respectively. Jarno Trulli meanwhile made it
                out onto the track and set the seventh fastest
                time. <br>
                <br>
                With just over five minutes of the session
                remaining Ferrari&#146;s Rubens Barrichello
                joined Michael Schumacher in setting a lap time
                below 1m30s &#150; the Brazilian set the fastest
                time of the weekend with a 1m29.705s lap. The BMW
                WilliamsF1 team drivers were on a mission
                meanwhile as Ralf Schumacher rocketed up to sixth
                and Montoya up to seventh. <br>
                In the final minute of the session Rubens
                Barrichello extended his lead at the top of the
                timing sheets by setting a lap in 1m29.056s
                &#150; some 0.7s faster than team mate Michael
                Schumacher. Schumacher however was on track and
                responded setting a new personal best of
                1m29.368s. </strong></font><a
