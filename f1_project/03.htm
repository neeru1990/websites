        isn't about 22 cars going around in circles; it&#146;s a
        team sport that involves strategy, timing, and accuracy
        at the highest level of competition. Global leaders from
        all leagues of business participate in this sport that
        demands great investments of time, money and dedication.
        A sport that runs solely on technology and passion. 17
        races were held in the year 2000 which spanned across 5
        continents. Every team carried out rigorous testing
        sessions in the winter before the commencement of the
        season that included race simulations of every track
        under different circumstances. But testing alone never
        decides who the winner will be. </strong></font></td>

        human virtues are tested and only the most courageous
        survive. Qualifying position, fuel consumption,
        tyre-wear, time spent in pit lane, probable weather and
        ability of the circuit/driver combination to provide
        overtaking opportunities are just some of the other
        factors a team has to focus on before the start of every
        event throughout the year. This project tries to shed
        some light on what actually goes on in the world of F1.
        The pain and hard work the engineers and mechanics are
        exposed to throughout the year in extreme climates, team
        strategies and problems, the approximate cost, how a team
        moves from one race venue to another and also how to get
        a job in this amazing sport are just some of the topics
        covered in this documentation. It can be rated a success
        even if one genuine F1 fan is generated.</strong></font></td>
