        for a top Grand Prix team can amount to over fifty days'
        of solid two-car test work during the year, adding around
        £1.5m to each team's budget. The exact details of this
        annual schedule will be debated between the Team Manager
        and the Chief Engineer and it is then the job of the Test
        Team Manager to action that plan. <br>

                everyone else struggling to climb up that
                slippery pole! Most well-heeled teams will

                &amp; engines, equipment, etc. as. Fortunately

                so at least the travelling involved is not too

        modern F1 team will have a design staff of a minimum of
        thirty-five highly-qualified and motivated designers, all
        working flat out to dream up ways of making their
        particular specialist area of the car work more
        efficiently. Particular importance is given to
        aerodynamics these days so often there will be revised
        designs of wings and wing-end plates, barge-boards,
        floors, airboxes and generally any aero-type tweak that
        the team can think of. <br>
        <br>
        All these developments will have been intensively tested
        in a wind tunnel first and details computed for improved
        lift/drag ratio but the actual &quot;feel&quot; of the
        car can only be truly realised on the track. There may be
        some weight-saving parts to be tested - F1 teams
        continually struggle to reduce the overall weight of the
        car in order to have more moveable ballast to play with
        to affect the handling characteristics of the car. There
        can also be some new parts designed and manufactured to
        increase the car's reliability which need testing. Most
        teams will operate a policy of never introducing new
        parts to the car at a race meeting unless they have been
        exhaustively tested at pre-event tests first.<br>

                information it needs on the development parts

                every conceivable parameter of the car as it
                circulates around the track. These systems are
                &quot;state of the art&quot; and require a horde
                of electronic boffins to operate them and
                decipher the information. It is true that there
                is no hiding place on the track for the modern GP
                driver. If he claims he's flat through a certain
                corner &amp; his engineer doubts it, the
                telemetry will reveal all.</strong></font></td>

        <td><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Setting-up
        the cars prior to a Grand Prix will involve a
        considerable amount of work refining gear-ratios, damper,
        spring or torsion-bar settings, ride-heights and rake,
        cambers, casters, wing-angles, diff settings, tyre
        pressures; in fact virtually anything you care to name on
        the car will be infinitely adjustable. It is very
        important for the driver to know how he wants the car to
        &quot;feel&quot; during this testing.<br>
        <br>
        A further very important aspect to testing these days is
        the use of a 7-post hydraulic simulator, often referred
        to as a &quot;shaker rig&quot;. This expensive and
        complex device will be installed in its own room at the
        team's base and will be capable of simulating any lap of
        any circuit with a full-scale racing car astride it. It
        will simulate not only the ride effects of the car on a
        particular track but also downforce levels front &amp;
        rear. The rig will have been pre - programmed for a
        particular track using previously gathered data from the
        onboard car telemetry systems. <br>
        <br>
        Top teams will set aside a complete race car - identical
        to those being taken to the GP - to use exclusively on
        the &quot;shaker rig&quot; over a GP weekend which will
        be permanently manned with its own specialist technicians
        and mechanics. That way the race engineers can telephone
        - or even e-mail from the pitwall - back to the
        technicians at base while a practise session is in full
        swing and request them to evaluate a different setting on
        the &quot;shaker rig&quot; car that maybe they haven't
        got time to try on the race car itself.<br>
        <br>
        So, ultimately, what is the purpose of all this testing
        effort? Clearly making the car go faster is the primary
        aim. The reason it doesn't usually affect the &quot;world
        order&quot; of F1 is, of course, that all the teams are
        testing all the time so to progress beyond your
        early-season form requires your team's testing programme
        to be even more intense and effective than that of your
        rivals. And that's not easy! </strong></font></td>
