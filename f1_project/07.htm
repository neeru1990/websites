        strategies in Formula 1 look so easy and obvious when
        you're watching the race from the comfort of your
        armchair but, on the 'prat-perch' hotseat at the track,
        there will be engineers from every team sweating hard
        over what decisions to make to win the race for their
        man. The execution of a successful strategy will have
        involved many man-hours of computer toil and then the
        ability to juggle all the 'strategy balls' in the air to
        arrive at the most advantageous result..</strong></font><table

                is a set of six key 'building blocks' that most
                teams will go through on a Grand Prix weekend or
                in testing beforehand to gain the knowledge
                required to begin setting a race strategy. <br>
                These are qualifying position, fuel consumption,
                tyre-wear, time spent in pitlane, probable
                weather and ability of the circuit/driver
                combination to provide overtaking opportunities.</strong></font></td>

        <p><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Most
        teams will arrange to test at the European tracks some 10
        days prior to a Grand Prix. This allows them to monitor
        both fuel consumption, tyre-wear and pit-lane entry/exit
        times in a very detailed and controlled manner,
        especially if part of the test includes a full race
        simulation run. This data is then fed into the computer
        and this usually points to a very obvious result showing
        whether a one-stop, two-stop or three-stop strategy is
        likely to provide the quickest overall race time. Very
        simply, the more fuel you run in the car, the heavier it
        will be. Heavier = slower and often more tyre-wear.
        However more fuel = less pitstops and less time taken in
        the pitlane as well as the 'In' and 'Out' laps which are
        usually slower than a normal racing lap.<br>
        <br>
        All the top drivers will endlessly practice the art of
        approaching the pitlane as fast as they dare in order to
        cross the pitlane entry line at or just below the
        regulation 80kph. Additionally, a top driver will often
        be very impressive indeed on both his 'In' and 'Out' laps
        whereas a driver with less experience may struggle
        initially to keep his concentration at this critical
        moment and be unable to keep pushing hard. Both the
        driver's race engineer and the driver himself will
        usually finally decide the race strategy. The race
        engineer will often work into the early hours of Sunday
        morning to finalise the best strategy available; although
        you sometimes wouldn't think so when you see the dire
        results from some of their efforts.<br>
        <br>
        Above all, the best strategies give the driver/engineer
        combination the flexibility to adjust their plan as the
        race progresses. This can be important for several
        reasons; for example, if you're on pole and your 'light
        fuel-load strategy' dictated that you streak off into the
        distance, what happens if you fluff your start and then
        are held up behind a slower car. Your light fuel load
        plan is wasted because you can't maximise the speed it
        gives you - time for a rethink! Track position is also a
        most important factor in the whole equation - there's
        clearly no point in being massively fast in the early
        part of the race, pitting and then exiting the pits
        behind the Minardis and the Prosts who may hold you up
        for the next 10 laps. So thinking on your feet is a most
        important ability for a top race engineer and few equal
        the mental agility that Ross Brawn seems able to provide
        every alternate weekend.<br>

                change in weather conditions will alter most
                team's strategies during a race so accurate
                weather forecasting is essential. Most teams will
                subscribe to an e-mailed or faxed daily weather
                forecasting service for the local area and obtain
                additional information from the local aerodrome
                if it's nearby. For those with unlimited budgets,
                stationing a few strategically placed observers
                around the track and upwind of the weather with
                team radios can pay great dividends. </strong></font></td>

        can often be raining hard on one side of the track but
        bone-dry in front of the pits! If it rains hard, the
        lap-times will increase dramatically as the tyre-wear
        reduces. If you think it will continue to rain, a sound
        policy is to arrange for your driver(s) to pit
        immediately for wet tyres and fill the car right up to
        the brim with fuel. That way, you can hopefully make the
        end of the race without a further stop, especially if a
        few pace-car interventions assist your car's fuel economy
        along the way! It is often surprising how few teams seem
        brave enough to gamble on this option though. Another
        often-used strategy may be to shadow the car in front and
        then attempt to gain an advantage (and track position) by
        pitting at the same time as your rival but short-filling
        the car to gain a pit-stop time advantage. This is
        especially useful if a slower car in front is holding up
        your car but which still cannot be overtaken in the
        conventional sense on the track.<br>
        <br>
        The key to success with all these strategies is decisive,
        logical and rapid decision-making coupled to clear
        communications between the team's race engineer and both
        drivers and pit-crew. Occasionally, a team manager's
        intimate knowledge of the FIA's Sporting Regulations will
        be severely tested when unexpected circumstances occur.
        Ferrari pulled a masterstroke at the 1998 British Grand
        Prix when Schumacher was given a 10-second penalty
        towards the end of the race. Article 13 of the Sporting
        Regulations states: &quot;The (Control) Line is a single
        line that crosses both the Track and the Pitlane&quot;.
        Result - Ferrari bring Schumi into the pits, he crosses
        the line to win the race and then takes his penalty!</strong></font></td>
