        Formula One races are won or lost in the pits these days.
        It's a sad reflection on the rulebook that the only way
        it seems possible to overtake another driver is by your
        pit-crew producing a faster stop than your rival. As a
        result, the stops take on tremendous importance for the
        teams who are continuously looking at ways to decrease
        their car's stationary time in pitlane. To ensure that
        this operation passes off with minimum time loss, regular
        dress rehearsals are held with each mechanic being
        expected to know his individual role by heart allowing
        his actions to eventually become automatic reflexes. Most
        teams will practise these stops early on a raceday
        morning as well as the preceding Thursday. A successful
        pit stop involves a minimum of twenty-two people working
        in total unison with each other.<br>

                mechanics on each corner of the car to change the

                kneeling on the ground with an air-powered
                wheelgun and, before the car has completely
                stopped, he will have located his gun onto the
                single, central wheel-nut &amp; be unlocking the
                nut. Virtually simultaneously another mechanic
                will have removed the old wheel and the third guy
                will be locating a new wheel onto the spigots
                ready for the gunman to torque the wheelnut up to
                the specified torque of 450ft/lbs. </strong></font></td>

        their job is done, the kneeling mechanic will raise his
        arm high in the air to signify that his work is
        completed. Two other mechanics will also have cleaned out
        the radiator ducts on both sides of the car to avoid any
        unnecessary debris (visor tear-offs, plastic bags, etc.)
        from causing the engine to overheat through blocked
        radiators. All of this will be done considerably faster
        than it took you to read this last paragraph! (roughly
        6-7 seconds)<br>
        <br>
        Three further people operate the re-fuelling. The rig
        operator will operate the 'Dead Man's Handle' on the
        Intertechnique rig which will be located at the front of
        the pit garage, one to attach the refuelling nozzle to
        the car and one to carry the very heavy hose over his
        shoulder behind the refuelling man. The refuelling hose
        is not easy to attach to the car as there are male
        locating lugs in the nozzle end that have to be
        accurately located to the car's female attachment which
        means that unless the angle of attachment is exactly
        correct, the hose won't attach. As with aircraft, the
        fuel is measured by weight rather than volume so a
        two-stop race strategy may see around 60kg of fuel
        gushing into the car's tank in around 4-5 seconds. The
        rate of flow is 12-13 litres/second.<br>
        <br>
        There will be a further two personnel operating
        quick-lift jacks at either end of the car. The mechanic
        wheels the jack into position before applying all his
        weight to the other end to lift the car. A third person
        will steady the car while it's off the ground by holding
        onto the roll-hoop. This is necessary to hold the car
        still while the wheels are being changed, and to ensure
        the refuelling nozzle can be attached successfully.
        Finally there is the Lollipop Man who is responsible for
        guiding the car into its correct pit and then not
        releasing the car until the entire process is completed.
        The Lollipop itself also reminds the driver to keep his
        foot on the brake ('Brakes On') and when to select 1st
        gear ('Gear!') There is also a Fireman manning a 25kg
        Halon fire extinguisher just in case anything should go
        wrong. <br>

                face="Verdana"><strong>Firstly, it's vital that
                the driver stops exactly on the marks that have
                been set for him. This is usually a box marked
                out in the pitlane with white tape showing him
                where he must place the car's wheels. The first
                problem is that, because of today's high cockpit
                sides, the driver can't see where he is stopping.
                Secondly, as the driver is coming down pitlane at
                the regulation 80kph speed-limit (60kph for
                Monaco), he wants to brake as late as possible to
                enter his pit in order to lose as little time as
                possible. </strong></font></td>

        <td><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>This,
        coupled with an often slippery surface outside the pit
        garages, makes it very easy for the car to overshoot the
        box and, even if this is only by a couple of feet, it can
        cause major problems as suddenly the entire pit-stop crew
        are in the wrong position! Even 18 inches short or long
        in the box area will delay the stop by a couple of
        seconds as the mechanics re-align their equipment &amp;
        position to service the car. Worse still, the car can hit
        either the front jackman or one of the kneeling wheel-gun
        men, which can cause unpleasant injuries very easily. <br>
        <br>
        Most teams' real fears centre on some kind of fuel-rig
        failure. These are fortunately very rare but the
        consequences of equipment failure can be potentially
        horrendous. One team in the Brazilian GP this year
        managed to dowse their car &amp; driver with fuel during
        the race's pit-stop when a sight-tube retaining ring on
        the fuel-hose nozzle had not been correctly re-assembled
        during pre-event maintenance and worked loose. Fuel
        sprayed everywhere and the driver actually had fuel
        dripping down the inside of his visor! Only a miracle
        avoided a major and serious fire as, had any of the fuel
        touched the red-hot exhausts or a brake disc, it would
        certainly have ignited and caused a major pit-fire.<br>
        <br>
        Teams will practice many different pit-stop scenarios
        including changing the front and rear wing assemblies,
        changing failed electronic boxes and steering-wheels,
        re-starting the engine if the driver has stalled it
        during the stop and even what to do in the event of the
        wrong car appearing down the pit-lane; i.e. the team are
        expecting Coulthard and Hakkinen appears. Each car has
        its own supply of FIA numbered wheels along with an
        FIA-appointed observer stationed in the team's garage
        during the event so putting the wrong wheels on a car
        will result in certain disqualification at the end of the
        race, as Arrows found out last year in the French GP. </strong></font></td>
