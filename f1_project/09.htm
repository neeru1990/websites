        often have you heard drivers and commentators talking
        about dirty air? A strange term it must be said, yet it
        refers to a very real problem Grand Prix drivers are
        faced with and must take much of the blame for the lack
        of action we see on the track. It refers to the effect of
        the disturbance the car in front has on the air. This
        causes a problem because Grand Prix cars depend to a
        large degree on their wings to help them grip around
        corners. Like inverted aeroplane wings, instead of making
        the car fly, they push it down onto the road allowing it
        to corner faster.<br>

                face="Verdana"><strong>Airflow is a strange
                thing, though, and it can be easily upset. The
                flow over the car's wings needs to be smooth and
                undisturbed, the kind of flow you get when
                driving through still, undisturbed air. However,
                when a racing car cuts through the air, it
                creates a mass of turbulence commonly referred to
                as dirty air. Any car following, will find that
                this disturbance has a dramatic effect on the
                efficiency of its wings, producing less downforce
                and less grip.</strong></font></td>

        net result is when one car gets close enough to try and
        overtake the car in front, it is suddenly at a huge
        disadvantage. Less grip makes it slower round the
        corners, and that means slower down the straights too.
        Above all, it makes overtaking massively more difficult.
        This was not always the case, however, due to another
        phenomenon associated with following another racing car.
        In addition to upsetting your downforce, being the
        following car has an advantage. As it plunges through the
        air, the leading car creates a hole that quickly closes
        behind it. Get close enough behind the leader and you are
        not pushing as much air. With less work to do, the car
        accelerates better and will ultimately go faster catching
        the car in front.<br>
        <br>
        This is slipstreaming and has been known about ever since
        racing cars started going reasonably quickly. In the days
        before the dependence on wings to improve grip, this put
        would put the car behind at an advantage. On a fast
        circuit like Monza or Hockenheim, the following car could
        accelerate up behind the leader, ducking out at the last
        minute and use the extra momentum to slingshot past.Often
        races would go on like this from start to finish with the
        disadvantaged leader being continually replaced by
        another. Obviously it would be great to return to these
        heady days but it is not so simple. <br>
        <br>
        Technology cannot be uninvented, and while rules can
        outlaw certain aspects of it, the underlying principle
        will still be exploited somehow. Having said that, there
        are moves afoot to frame technical regulations that will
        put the following vehicle at less of a disadvantage. In
        the US, ChampCar organisers came up with a device to
        reduce downforce and hence cornering speeds. It is a
        simple vertical panel across the back of a rear wing, but
        it was found to have an interesting side effect. Suddenly
        following cars were at less of a disadvantage and the
        track action perked up accordingly.<br>
        <br>
        Whether anything like that will come to pass in Formula 1
        is in the hands of the organisers. Alternatively, they
        could simply ban wings, but how would you replace all
        that valuable advertising space? </strong></font></td>
