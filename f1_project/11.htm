                forty-five people to a race who form the
                operating core of the Race Team. The advance
                guard consisting of four &quot;truckies&quot;
                aboard an articulated Transporter and a
                rigid-bodied Transporter will leave their base
                sometime over the preceding weekend and arrive at
                the Grand prix track on the Monday night before a
                race. These trucks will carry all of the garage
                support equipment including the banner system for
                decorating the sides and back of the garage and a
                complete overhead gantry system to support
                lighting, air, power and computer connections for
                all three race cars.</strong></font></td>

        <p><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>They
        will also carry some of the bulkier items such as the two
        Intertechnique refuelling rigs, the
        &quot;prat-perches&quot;, team scooters and around forty
        sets of wheel-rims and tyre-warming blankets. The
        truckies' first job on arriving will be to clean and
        paint the pit garage floors in order that the setting-up
        of the garage banners, air and electric supplies can
        begin unhindered on Tuesday. The complete set-up will
        take a further two days of hard slog and results in a
        complete internal team garage being constructed within
        the circuit's own pits. This early crew will also oversee
        the installation of up to four ISDN lines in the garage,
        which are then used to carry the team's e-mail and data
        traffic both back to base and around the world. Many
        teams will have technicians and engineers back at base
        scanning all the telemetry from the cars as it's
        happening. In fact, Ferrari have their own satellite dish
        and permanent link in order to be certain of confidential
        and reliable communications between the track &amp;
        Maranello.<br>
        <br>
        Another major job for this advance guard will be to set
        up the team's &quot;Prat-Perch&quot; stands (great name
        even though I did sit on it - don't know who thought of
        it!) along the pit-rail. These contraptions will usually
        seat around eight personnel (2 x Race Engineers, 2 x Data
        Engineers, Chief Engineer, Team Manager, Team Owner &amp;
        Engine Manufacturer's representative) and will become the
        team's nerve centre during the race &amp; qualifying. A
        bank of fifteen TV monitors will provide access to every
        TV picture being captured around the circuit along with
        data channels displaying lap-times, sector times, cars on
        circuit, weather and any messages from Race Control. The
        Engineers will also be able to monitor real time car data
        via an infrared data link beaming the signals from the
        pit garage to the prat-perch. The crew will also have the
        job of feeding the team from the Wednesday through to the
        Sunday night. Feeding a hungry crew of around forty-five
        with three hearty meals a day from a mobile kitchen is no
        small task and some of the team's cooks are legendary
        figures around the paddock!<br>

                Wednesday preceding the Grand Prix, the majority
                of the team will fly in to join their colleagues
                at the track. A further two Transporters with
                four more Truckies will arrive at the circuit
                during the afternoon. One of these will carry the
                three cars and a huge selection of spare parts
                and consumables. This truck will also house a
                complete machining centre comprising lathe, mill,
                drill, linisher, borescope and full welding
                facilities. </strong></font></td>

        <p><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>The
        other transporter will serve primarily as a mobile office
        suite, with one office for the Race Engineers and Drivers
        and a further office for the Team Manager and his
        assistant. It may also be used for additional storage
        carrying including housing the massive two 20metre high
        radio antennae which are erected by compressed air and
        stand high above the transporters' roofs to transmit
        &amp; receive voice &amp; data signals to the cars while
        travelling around the circuit. Both the teams'
        transporters will carry 90kva generators so that they are
        completely self-contained for power in case the circuit's
        own power supply becomes over-loaded and crashes. Quite a
        normal occurrence at some circuits unfortunately! An
        average track day for a mechanic will involve leaving the
        team's hotel around 6.00am in time to grab a quick
        breakfast at the track before continuing work on the car.
        It can be rare for these guys to be back at their hotel
        much before midnight on each of the three
        &quot;running&quot; days so, by Sunday night, you will
        have a lot of very tired mechanics propping up the bar! <br>
        <br>
        Packing up is a very rapid affair in comparison to
        setting-up. The majority of the team will be aiming to
        fly home on the last available Sunday night flight and
        then a skeleton crew is left behind to finish packing up
        the garage banners and gantry on the Monday. The cars
        will be back at base from most European GPs by Tuesday
        but, by the following Monday, those transporters must be
        rolling again towards the next race. Such a schedule
        leaves little time for testing, development and updates
        to the cars, let alone holidays and time-off for the team
        members! </strong></font></p>
