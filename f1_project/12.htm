        in Formula One are cloaked in secrecy and intrigue.
        Telephone number-like figures are bandied around by all
        concerned but few people appear to have much idea of how
        these numbers are actually arrived at. However one thing
        is certain - F1 is a very expensive past time indeed and,
        if you want a sensible shot at winning the title, then
        you'd better have very deep pockets and not be shy about
        spending it!<br>

                every team's budgets - capital expenditure and
                operating costs. If you wanted to set up your

                you'd require would be an entry. Having secured
                your entry ticket, the next thing you require is
                a factory. You really need about 175,000 sq.ft of
                space in order to include the mandatory 50%-scale
                wind-tunnel, two autoclaves, machine tools,
                design office and R &amp; D Laboratory. With a
                staff of around 300 to 500 people, a modern F1
                team needs a lot of space.</strong></font></td>

        will need to be space to house around eight F1 cars with
        surrounding benches as well as departments covering
        sub-assembly, gearboxes, hydraulics, electronics,
        marketing, finance and management. The cost of all this?
        With equipment and fitting-out, you need to budget around
        $30m. Your next large capital outlay will be transport.
        Most teams operate a fleet of 8-10 trucks, a couple of
        motorhomes and a small fleet of delivery vans. The racing
        transporters and motorhomes are filled with hi-tech
        equipment and must all be built by specialist
        manufacturers. Each transporter can cost $750,000 (fully
        equipped and including tractor unit) and you're going to
        need at least six of them. The top motorhomes these days
        are costing close to $2m each. So that's around a further
        $10m to get your show on the road by the time they're all
        painted and customised just how you want them!<br>
        <br>
        The operating costs of an F1 team depend very much on its
        level of competitiveness and the funds it has available.
        BAR, McLaren and Ferrari are the three biggest spenders
        this year with operating budgets ranging from $120m to
        $250m. Further down the grid, Williams, Benetton, Sauber,
        Jordan &amp; Jaguar will be spending $70m to $90m with
        Prost, Arrows &amp; Minardi getting through around
        $50-60m each. <br>
        <br>
        The difference in these spends will be accounted for
        through many different factors ranging from the cost of
        employing drivers and star design staff to whether the
        team is paying for its engine supply or not. However
        drivers are not the only expensive employees for F1
        teams. The Technical Director and Chief Designer and the
        other 300-odd staff also have really handsome salaries.
        The cost of operating both a Race and Test Team will
        swallow around $12m per year. This will cover wages for
        the sixty or so personnel engaged to operate the teams
        and the travel, freight &amp; hotel costs in addition to
        other items such as circuit rental for testing, team
        clothing, a supply of &quot;Dry Ice&quot; at all the
        races and all the necessary equipment that the teams
        carry with them. Some teams will need to pay for their
        engine and tyre supply, which will amount to another
        substantial cost. <br>

                face="Verdana"><strong>The regulations state that
                all F1 teams must build their own cars and this
                will account for a huge proportion of each team's
                budget. A front-running team may build as many as
                eight cars in a season and each complete rolling
                chassis will cost at least $1m each. However the
                really massive cost comes in the manufacturing of
                spare and performance-update parts during the
                year. Overall, allow somewhere between $25-28m
                for car build during a year and you won't be far
                out.</strong></font></td>

        order to ensure that your car is going to be competitive,
        the pace of development must be kept up throughout the
        year. This means a design staff of around thirty highly
        trained and motivated engineers working with the very
        latest CAD systems and all operating in conjunction with
        an 18-hour/day wind-tunnel programme for aerodynamic
        testing. By the time you've added in a cost for R &amp; D
        work as well (shaker-rig, proof testing of components,
        development of crazy &quot;boffin-inspired&quot; schemes)
        you can kiss goodbye to a further $10m per annum.<br>
        <br>
        So, as you can see, there's not much change from $80-90m
        for running a competitive F1 effort and that's before
        you've made any sort of profit whatsoever! It pays to
        have deep pockets. If you divide the total requisite
        budget by the amount of kilometres covered in a season,
        you will arrive at a cost of competing of around
        $2500/kilometre. This means that each lap of Silverstone
        will cost around $7500 and that includes the installation
        laps as well. <br>
