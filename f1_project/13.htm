        people wish to get involved in the Formula 1 circus.
        However, most of the pilots start racing since they were
        5 years old and have then majored through the higher
        formulae. So, if you have still not started racing and
        can understand this documentation then you are probably
        too old; besides you need to have a $5-10 million
        sponsorship backup to be able to get into racing in the
        first place. However, your options for being a part of
        the team are still open. <br>

                face="Verdana"><strong>So, as an attempt to help
                those of you out there who are crazy enough to
                want to be involved, here are a few suggestions
                to get you started. It's not going to be easy -
                that's for certain - so you'd better be very
                determined and very sure that it's something you
                really want to do otherwise it's best left alone.
                Motor sport in general can be a very demanding,
                uncertain and insecure career! Don't expect to
                have much time left at home as time schedules in
                motorsport are very demanding and, in the scarce
                time you may have at home, all you'll want to do
                is catch up on your sleep!</strong></font></td>

        face="Verdana"><strong>If your chosen career path is as
        an engineer, designer, aerodynamicist or electronics
        boffin, then you're going to need a first-class honours
        degree in the relevant subject before most of the Formula
        One teams will consider you. Some motorsport
        organisations may be prepared to assist you in gaining
        the relevant academic qualification and, in particular,
        Reynard Motorsport Group, Prodrive and TWR are very
        active in encouraging young engineers into a motorsport
        career.<br>
        <br>
        There will be quite a few Technical Directors and Team
        Managers of both teams and manufacturers who will be
        happy to advise you on which courses you should be
        studying to achieve a job with their company and often a
        personalised letter to them will bring forth some
        valuable advice, as well as introducing your name to them
        for the future. Many of the teams will also have Human
        Resources departments so contact them and make a friend
        of the HR manager. She'll know what vacancies are
        currently available and may keep your name on a priority
        list if you make a positive impression initially. Worse
        case, she'll give you good advice on how you can progress
        and improve your chances of achieving a position within
        motorsport.<br>
        <br>
        Other available positions in teams may include
        accountants, IT people, Truck Drivers, Chefs, Marketing
        &amp; PR people, secretarial and stores people so there
        are many professions you can choose from and still be
        involved in motorsport. So, let's assume you've chosen a
        career path as a mechanic in motor racing. How do you get
        started? Initially, get a job in your local garage and
        learn as much as you can about general vehicle mechanics
        and engineering. Go to night school for a Tech. Course
        and make sure you attend all the lectures and pass your
        exams with flying colours. You may need these
        qualifications later to impress a future employer of your
        achievement and dedication and don't think you will be
        the only one applying for a job!<br>

                face="Verdana"><strong>The most obvious next step
                - and how the majority get involved - is to offer
                your services to your local Formula Ford or
                Touring Car team and then work your way up the
                ladder from there. From there, if you work hard,
                are truly committed and passionate about what you
                do, you can progress upwards in the team through
                mechanicing. Maybe you'll have to initially work
                for nothing when you just help the team out at
                weekends but, if you can impress the team
                sufficiently with your enthusiasm, sooner or
                later you'll be offered something better and more
                permanent.</strong></font></td>

        <td><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Always
        remember that the more people you can get to know within
        motorsport, the greater your chance of securing a
        permanent position for yourself. Junior team positions
        tend to get filled very quickly and, because many of the
        senior personnel in a team have such hectic schedules,
        it's often whom you know rather than what you know that
        is important.<br>
        <br>
        When you get to interview, you'll need to persuade the
        team not only of your work abilities and enthusiasm for
        the job, but also your ability to act as part of a
        closely-knit team and your aptitude for working on your
        own initiative and without constant supervision. Think
        hard about why the team should choose you over all those
        other hopefuls sitting alongside you in
        &quot;Reception&quot; and then don't be afraid to &quot;
        go for it&quot;! Unconventional and forward-thinking
        people run most teams and individualism is valued highly.
        So remember, if you want the job badly enough, there are
        twelve F1 teams out there you can pick on and chances are
        one of them will need your help one day! Good Luck!</strong></font><font
