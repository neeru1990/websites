        <TD colspan="2" class="tradition"><P>India has a variety of indigenous tastes and food and has also been influenced by a lot of foreign cuisines throughout her history. These influences have been the result of foreign traders and investors passing through and making India their home. Besides these influences, her own culture and heritage have added tremendous tastes, color and an assortment of unique spices passed over throughout the generations.</P>
          <P class="tradition">Indian cuisine combines a lot of world preferences and characteristics, apart from adding its own aromatic blend of herbs, spices, chili, ginger, garlic and local produce.</P>
          <P>Just as Japanese sushi relies on the freshness of the meat and Chinese food relies on the various sauces to impart the right flavor and taste, Indian food relies on the spices in which it is cooked. Spices have always been considered to be India&rsquo;s prime commodity and they play an important role in Indian cooking. They mainly add a unique blend of color, aroma and flavor, providing the all round basis for visual, smell and taste appeal. Essential spices include curry leaves for their unique flavor, cloves and cumin seeds for their aroma, chili powder &amp; turmeric for its taste and color amongst others. These spices are integral to each dish and can alter the taste as well as the color and texture in various combinations.</P>
          <P>Wheat, Rice, Lentils and an assortment of vegetables, form the basis of a typical staple Indian meal. Vegetables are used extensively in Indian cooking and a majority of dishes are vegetarian. Meat and fish do play a role, albeit in smaller quantities. Vegetable or meat curries are complimentary to the staple food. An all rounded Indian meal consists of some hors d&rsquo;oeuvres, chapatti&rsquo;s, vegetables or meat, rice, lentils and accompaniments that have cooling qualities such as yogurt based raita or fresh vegetable salads and a sweet dish.</P>
          <P>Each day, the family comes together at the dining table to enjoy an assortment of the above flavors cooked in a variety of forms and textures, and the rich tastes and colors provide basis for some much needed bonding.</P>
          <P>We welcome you to explore a mix of the above influences combined with a unique blend of flavors, textures, produce and meat and taste the difference.</P></TD>
