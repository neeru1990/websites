      <P><STRONG> </STRONG>The entire process is based on a series of operations called the LINE operation. There are a total of 9 stages. </P>

      <OL> 
        <LI><STRONG>Slugs Punching<BR> 
          </STRONG>The Slugs are made from aluminum Ingots. Ingots are melted into sheets then after strip are made and slugs are punched according to requirements. Slugs are round shape like a coin. The purity ranges from 99.5% - 99.7%. <BR> 
          <BR> 
        </LI> 
        <LI><STRONG>Slug Extrusion <BR> 
          </STRONG>Slugs, after being annealed are put into the extrusion press. This involves subjecting the slug to immense pressure, as a result of which of softness.<BR> 
          <BR> 
        </LI> 
        <LI><STRONG>Annealing<BR> 
          </STRONG>Extruded tubes have a hard surface. So in order to soften them up they are annealed in the oven under a temperature of 350 &deg;C so that they have thr right degree of softness.<BR> 
          <BR> 
        </LI> 
        <LI><STRONG>Trimming <BR> 
          </STRONG>Next is the trimming process, which involves threading, shaving and trimming of the mouth and shoulder of the tube. <BR> 
          <BR> 
        </LI> 
        <LI><STRONG>Coating &amp; Printing <BR> 
          </STRONG>The coating and printing machine is comprised of a coating machine and a 4 colour offset machine, together with a drying oven, where in the tubes duly lacquered, are passed through a conveyor belt. At JAL, we have adopted Nylo-plates for sharper printing quality, instead of the usual zinc plates. <BR> 
          <BR> 
        </LI> 
        <LI><STRONG>Lacquering <BR> 
          </STRONG>As a safeguard against chemical reactions between the tube and the contents, the tubes are subjected to internal lacquering where the interior is uniformly coated with protective lacquer coates. <BR> 
          <BR> 
        </LI> 
        <LI><STRONG>Capping <BR> 
          </STRONG>The caps are affixes in a separate room, where measures such as wearing special headgear are strictly abided, in order to prevent entry of extraneous matter, like hair or dust &amp; small particles are removed. <BR> 
          <BR> 
        </LI> 
        <LI><STRONG>Dust Resistance</STRONG> <BR> 
          After the capping is done the tubes are passed through in a Blower machine where the dust and small particles are removed. <BR> 
          <BR> 
        </LI> 
        <LI><STRONG>Packing <BR> 
          </STRONG>Packing of the finished tubes is done as per the client's requirements. Accordingly, the tubes are packed in corrugated boxes, with or without partitions or as per the client's instructions. The boxes are shrinked pack in a special machine. </LI>
