    <TD valign="top" width="494"><P><FONT size="2" face="Verdana">It all started 
        in 1904, when two aspiring brothers landed up in Mumbai, in search of 
        success in the city of dreams. It was this ambition for success, which 
        led to the foundation of MUKTAGIRI PAINTERS, now one of the oldest advertising 
        firms in Mumbai. The firm, which was the brainchild of the younger of 
        the two brothers, Muktagiri Pangaonkar, was established on 16<SUP>th</SUP> 
        Jan. 1905.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size="2" face="Verdana"> Success was not easy to come by in those 
        days of heavy taxes, but as the years passed by, the firm grew and it 
        now dealt with the manufacturing and leasing of drama curtains, which 
        were quite a success in those days of theatre.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size="2" face="Verdana"> But, with the theatre industry starting 
        to decline, it was time to explore unknown areas. Thus began the manufacturing 
        of large size hoardings, banners and wooden letters plated with gold. 
        Surprisingly enough, Muktagiri Painters was the only firm, which manufactured 
        and still manufactures these type of letters.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size="2" face="Verdana"> Later on, both of Muktagiri&#146;s sons, 
        Prabhakar and Rajkumar joined the business and helped in obtaining clients 
        like the Union Bank Of India, The Allahabad bank, etc. Muktagiri Painters 
        was now a truly well established and well-settled firm.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size="2" face="Verdana"> The firm is now handled by the grandsons 
        of Muktagiri viz. Ajitkumar and Prashant Pangaonkar. It now has multinational 
        companies like Tata, BPL, Thomas Cook and many others, (a glimpse of whom 
        you may catch on the clients page) as it&#146;s clients.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size="2" face="Verdana"> We shall soon be celebrating a 100 years 
        of success !</FONT></P>
