        <br>
        Muktagiri respects your right to privacy. This policy
        summarizes what personally identifiable information we
        may collect, and how we might use this information. This

        Muktagiri only will collect personally identifiable

        Before we collect any personally identifiable
        information, we will provide an explanation for the
        possible use of your data. The information you supply
        will be used by Muktagiri to respond to your inquiries,

        please contact us at <a
        href="mailto:muktagiri@yahoo.com?subject=Website Modificaion Request"><font size="2" face="Verdana">muktagiri@yahoo.com.</font></a> We will use

        Children and Parents <br>
        <br>
        Muktagiri does not intend to collect personally
        identifiable information from children under age 13
        without permission of the child's parent or legal

        personally identifiable information to Muktagiri only
        with the explicit permission of their parent or legal
        guardian. Where appropriate, Muktagiri will instruct
        children not to submit personal information. If your
        child has submitted personal information and you would
        like to request that such information be removed, you may
        do so as indicated above and Muktagiri will use
        reasonable efforts to comply with your request. <br>
