    <td class="content"><h5>Business Challenges</h5>
      <p>Companies across a  broad spectrum of industries rely on critical assets to drive their business. Manufacturing  companies rely on equipment availability and uptime to keep production lines  moving and meet production goals. Transport companies rely on fleets and  containers for timely cargo delivery. Financial services companies depend on  computer and networking systems to manage transactions and keep customer data  secure. And while the asset types across industries may be varied, there is  still a common need for effective management. Any item that is a part of the  work process but does not leave as part of a finished product is a candidate  for intelligent asset management with RFID. RFID can help enterprises  automatically track and secure these assets &mdash; with very little human  intervention. </p>
      <p>This real-time technology takes asset management to the next  level, providing unprecedented visibility, accuracy and security. With RFID,  companies can automatically keep track of key assets as they move in and out of  an area &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s a stock room, airport hangar, data center, or transport  terminal. With clear visibility into asset status and location, companies are  more likely to perform regular and necessary maintenance &mdash; from software  upgrades to lab equipment calibration. Fixed readers can be strategically  located throughout the facility to automatically track the movement of tagged  equipment in and out of buildings, rooms, or other sectors. Equipment movement  can be automatically correlated with employee identification &mdash; enabling secure  and automated asset check out from stock rooms and tool cribs. </p>
      <p>In addition,  RFID can automatically alert supervisors of any attempt to move a tagged item  from an authorized area, providing protection against security breaches and  asset loss. RFID also automates inventory counts, providing a complete,  accurate snapshot of asset status in a mere fraction of the time it would take  to conduct a physical manual inventory. To track assets with RFID, tags are  attached to all assets &mdash; from servers, racks, and laptops to office chairs,  carts, televisions etc. To take inventory, an employee can simply roam the  facility with a handheld RFID reader or a mobile RFID reader on a cart &mdash;  there&rsquo;s no need to properly identify the asset, locate a bar code, and scan  each asset one by one. Without the intensive labor, companies can afford to  replace the annual audit with weekly or even more frequent inventory counts.  And RFID&rsquo;s automation eliminates the costly errors associated with manual  inventory, including missed or mis-categorized assets. The result is an  up-to-date accurate picture of asset status as frequently as needed to best  manage the business.</p>
