    <td class="content"><p>People  are one of the most important assets for any organization. Providing efficient  systems for managing employee information/ history, payrolls, time-in/  time-out, and many other such aspects is one of the most important tasks that  the HR department of any organization has. </p>
      <p>NeoTechID  Employee Management System helps ease out this task by providing integrated  RFID/ Biometric management system tailored to your organization&rsquo;s needs.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h5>RFID Access Control </h5>
      <p>Today  most organizations require an efficient access control system. An efficient  access control system not only enhances security to limit access to restricted  areas but also can be used to track employee activity.</p>
      <p>RFID  is one of the most popular choices for providing easy, fast, and hassle-free  access control. Employees carrying HF RFID tags (max read-range of 10 cm) show  their card to a RFID reader to gain access to secure areas. Further, individual  information about the employee can be stored in each card.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Access  information can then be sent to NeoTechID Employee Management System for  further processing the information.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h5>Biometric Time-in Time-out  system (with access control as an option)</h5>
      <p>Biometric  Time-in Time-out system (with access control as an option) is an effective way  to automate the time recording process for employees. It is a punctuality  improvement tool that offers a transparent environment to record the time-in  and time-out of individual employees, which can then be integrated to the  larger NeoTechID Employee Management System.</p>
