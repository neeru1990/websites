		  <br />
		  <p>NeoTechID can provide a complete end to end Library Management System, but at the same time we understand that the customer might have an existing setup that the customer might not want to replace altogether. Our experts will, in such cases, make note of the customer's requirements and help the customer upgrade only that part of the set up that the customer want. For example if the customer has an existing barcode based setup, our experts will help enhance the system to use RFIDs. Similarly if the customer has an existing Library Management Software to which the customer manually inputs all data then our experts can help integrate the existing solution with RFID technology so as to simply automate the data entry process.</p>
	  <p>Whatever needs are, our experts at NeoTechID can work out a solution that is both convenient for the user and is cost effective at the same time.<br />
