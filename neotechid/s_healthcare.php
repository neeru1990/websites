      <p>To err is human, but in the medical field it can be unpardonable... </p>
      <p>New born baby getting mixed up, a wrong patient being taken for surgery or a wrong procedure/surgery being performed...makes for news headlines. Is there a solution? Can automation help??</p>
      <p> We at NeoTechID, certainly believe it can! Issuing RFID tags to new borns or new admits to the hospital can provide the necessary verification at each stage. Additional information such as patient details, time of last check-up, next procedure/check-up due etc can be stored on the tag and checked before undertaking any procedure. Biometric identification systems can also be integrated for added checks.</p>
      <h5> <br />
        Equipment Tracking</h5>
      <p>        A hospital is synonymous with electromedical equipment and a significant number of these are high value portable devices. For example ECG machines, hand held dopplers, automated dialysis cyclers, defibrillators etc. 
        Not only is the security of this equipment important but so is the precise knowledge of their location. Any of the equipment may be required at short notice in critical situations and knowing where to find it can at times mean the difference between life and death! <br />
        RFID tagging can provide a fool proof solution.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h5>Staff  Management</h5>
