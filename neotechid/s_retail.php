    <td class="content"><p>To maximize sales opportunities, retailers need to make sure that the right product is on the shelf and available for the customer at the right time.  Item-level RFID applications can help retailers address this age-old problem while improving inventory and replenishment processes, increasing visibility into shrink, and automating tasks to reduce labor costs.</p>
      <p>Inadequate stocking levels translate into missed opportunities and sales &mdash; while overstocking to ensure that the right product is available at the right time leads to excessive capital requirements that can reduce profitability. Product availability is a significant factor in customer satisfaction and loyalty &mdash; industry studies reveal that consumers are likely to switch retail stores if they experience out-of-stock items just two or three times.</p>
      <p>With this in view, NeoTechID has come up with a package, which will help shop owners reduce cost, raise revenue and boost customer satisfaction. The following retail applications will definitely increase the ROI:<br />

      </p>
      <h5>Promotion Display Tracking</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Track in-store deployment of displays to ensure timely deployment and removal of the display per the marketing plan. </li>
        <li>Automatically record deployment of displays as they are taken on to the store floor.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5><br />
      In-Store Inventory Management &ndash; Items</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>RFID-enabled physical inventory.</li>
        <li>Using an RFID-equipped cart with a high-performance RFID reader, count tagged product simply by moving the cart down each aisle.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5><br />
      In-Store Inventory Management &ndash; Pallets</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Tag pallets and pallet-rack slots with RFID Tags.</li>
        <li>Automatically capture the location of pallets when put away by associating pallet and pallet rack tag numbers in the database.</li>
        <li>Provide forklift drivers with accurate locations of pallets of products for quick retrieval.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5><br />
      Brand Authentication</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The product tag contains both a customer-writable EPC number and a factory-set, unique tag ID (TID) number.</li>
        <li>The TID cannot be changed by a would-be counterfeiter, so an item with the correct pair of numbers is authentic. A quick check against a database using a handheld or desktop reader can verify authenticity by confirming properly paired numbers.</li>
        <li>Much more effective than other authentication methods that can be copied &ndash; the TID number is factory set by the tag manufacturer in the IC and is unique.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5><br />
      Inventory Visibility in the Supply Chain</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Track packaged goods from factory to retail floor, and produce from farm to grocery cooler.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Product is automatically registered as it passes through RFID-equipped dock doors and thruways, providing location information.<br />
  </li>
        <li>Empty case boxes and RPCs are captured as they leave the store floor, indicating usage.<br />
        </li>
      </ul></td>
