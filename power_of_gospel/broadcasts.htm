          <br>
            When Adam and Eve sinned against God, it appeared that   man forever was separated from God. But praise be to God that He had a plan of   restoration that He put in to action at Calvary to restore mankind back to   Himself. When sin came into the life of Adam and Eve, they could no longer enjoy   the presence of the holy God. They had to hid themselves among the shrubs of the   garden. When God sent them away from the garden and set up Cherubim to guard the   way to the garden, man was forever separated from God. But Jesus when He died on   the cross caused the veil of the temple to be torn into two (Luke 23:45) creating a way to the most holy place   symbolizing the restoration of that lost relationship.

          <br>
            When Adam and Eve sinned against God, it appeared that   man forever was separated from God. But praise be to God that He had a plan of   restoration that He put in to action at Calvary to restore mankind back to   Himself. One of things that Adam and Eve lost when they sinned was their   dignity. They realized that they were naked and shame covered them. But Jesus,   when He died on the cross hung in shame when the Roman soldiers divided His   clothes among them (Mark 15:4), taking up the   shamefulness of mankind on himselt to restore dignity to each one of   us.

          <br>
          God created Adam and Eve and placed them at the Garden   of Eden. It was a blessed life where Adam and Eve could enjoy the presence of   God all the time; their needs were provided for and they were filled with   innocent happiness. All of that came to an end when they sinned against the   Lord, disobeying his commandment not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of   good and evil. It appeared that man forever was separated from God. But praise   be to God that He had a plan of restoration that He put in to action at Calvary   to restore mankind back to Himself.

          <br>
          Jesus said in Matthew   7:21, "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom   of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven." I Thessalonians 5:18 says, "In everything give thanks;   for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you." We ought to give thanks to   God in everything, not only in a few things. We ought to quit looking at the   glass as half empty and start thanking God for the fullness He has provided   us.

          <br>
          Jesus said in Matthew   7:21, "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom   of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven." I Peter 2:15, 16 says, "For this is the will of God,   that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, as free,   yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God." God   calls on us to go good in counter the evil of this world.

          <br>
          Jesus said in Matthew   7:21, "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom   of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven." I Thessalonians 4:3 says, "For this is the will of   God, your sanctification!" To do the will of God means to live in holiness like   He who has called us is holy.

          <br>
          Jesus said in Matthew   7:21, "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom   of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven." In the second   message of this sermon series, we meditate on I Timothy   7:21, which says that it is God's will that every one is saved and come   to the knowledge of the truth. Are we saved? Salvation is a free gift that Jesus   gives to anyone who accepts Him. Listen to the Word and receive Him into your   life.

          <br>
          Jesus said in Matthew   7:21, "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom   of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven." Doing God's will   was food for Jesus. We ought to give that much importance to understand God's   will for us.
