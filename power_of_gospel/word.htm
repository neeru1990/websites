    <TD class="content"><span class="title">Effective Prayer requires absolute surrender
      </span>
      <br>
      <span class="author">by Suresh P. Babu      </span>
      <p class="em">Where do wars and fights come from among you? Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members? You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet you do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures. James 4:1-3</p>
      <p>Effective prayer, a prayer that receives an answer from God, a prayer that has the same effectiveness as that of the Elijah Prayer, requires an absolute surrender. It requires a surrender to God&rsquo;s will. Prayers attempting to twist God&rsquo;s hand to try and accomplish one&rsquo;s own desires contrary to the will of God will never receive an answer from God. James writes in <span class="em">James 4:3</span>, &ldquo;You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures.&rdquo; That is the prayer of many today. They come to the presence of God with a shopping list asking God to provide something they want somehow immediately. But prayer must be made with an introspection of oneself in light of the will of God and there must be a surrender to God&rsquo;s will as the prayer is offered. As a man of God once said, &ldquo;Prayer is a repetition in a thousand words of a simple phrase, &lsquo;Apart from me you can do nothing!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Jesus Christ was in the garden of Gethsemane. He knew that the time had come for Him to fulfill the purpose of His ministry on the earth. He knew that He would be beaten, He would be despised, He would be mocked and that He would be nailed to the cross. With a burdensome heart He came to the presence of Father God and prayed, &ldquo;O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.&rdquo; (<span class="em">Matthew 26:39</span>) If the Son of God Himself would surrender Himself totally as he prayed for His life, how much more should we surrender ourselves, our desires and our wishes into the sovereign hand of the Lord! </p>
      <p>Jesus Christ has given us freedom, freedom from the law and sin. But that freedom is not to be interpreted as free pass to do what ever we wanted. The freedom in Christ, comes with a responsibility. That freedom comes with a love that constrains one to do the will of God and not anything else. If you do not feel that responsibility and the love that constrains you from doing your own thing, question your salvation and turn to God and ask Him to reveal Himself more fully in your life. Paul writes in <span class="em">Romans 6:18</span>, &ldquo;And having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.&rdquo; That is exactly how we ought to view our relationship with Father God! We must constantly strive for the righteousness that God wants us to be enslaved to. Such righteous living would not allow us to pray a prayer that is aimed at fulfilling our own desires and lusts. Instead it will spur us on to pray a prayer that God desires us to pray, a prayer that surrenders our will totally and absolutely to the Will of the Father God! <span class="em">I Peter 2:15, 16</span> says, &ldquo;For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men -- as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God.&rdquo; We ought to be bondservants of God in Christ and be led by His perfect will for our lives. </p>
      <p>God has indeed blessed us to have authority over all things. God has given all His creation to be subject under the hand of man. As God blessed the man He had created on the earth, He said &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.&rdquo; (<span class="em">Genesis 1:28</span>) It is absolutely right for us to enjoy the provisions God has given into our hands. However, not all things are helpful for us to grow and be edified in the Lord. Paul writes in <span class="em">I Corinthians 10:23</span>, &ldquo;All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful; all things are lawful for me, but not all things edify.&rdquo; <span class="em">I Corinthians 6:12</span> says, &ldquo;All things are lawful for me, but all things are not helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.&rdquo; Do not be addicted to anything and pray for the satisfaction of that addiction. But as you pray and ask God for anything, center your prayer on the good and perfect will of God for your life. Pray a prayer that is not focusing on your own pleasures but on the perfect will of Father God. Then there shall be an answer to your prayer such as was received by Elijah. Hallelujah!</p>
      <p class="em">Prayer: Father, I come to Your throne of grace asking for Your strength and Your power on my life. I cannot lead a life without Your power. Help me to have a dedicated Godly life, separated for Your purpose. In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I pray. Amen. </p>
