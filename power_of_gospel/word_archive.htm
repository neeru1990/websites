            <br>          
          It is easy to pray a prayer containing a shopping list   asking God to give us many things. But that is not the kind of prayer that   receives an answer from God. A prayer that yields fully to the will of the   Father God, a prayer that surrenders one's own wishes and will into the soverign   hand of the Lord does receive an answer!

            <br>
            To receive mighty outpouring of God's power and to see   mighty answers to prayers like Elijah saw in His ministry, one must lead a Godly   life. Effectual prayers requires a price to be paid! That price is that of a   Godly life!

            <br>
          </A>God answers prayers even today, but to receive an   answer to your prayer, you need to have a relationship to Him! Without   relationship, there can be no answered prayer. Strained relationship drains all   hopes of an answered prayer. Come to Jesus today to renew your relationship with   Him so you too can see an asnwer to your prayers!

            <br>
          </A>Elijah was a man just like us but he was able to   command drought and then rain to come upon the nation. How come we do not see   Elijah prayers today? Why do we not see answers to prayers as mightily as Elijah   demonstrated? Does God answer prayers? What does an effectual prayer include? If   you are wondering, God wants to touch you with His truth!

          Are you looking for a deliverance, a miracle, a hope   for your future? There was a poor woman who lost her husband and it looked like   she was losing her entire livelihood until she received a miracle of deliverance   from the Lord. You too can receive your miracle today. Hallelujah!

            <br>
          When Jonathan was faithful in the little he could do at the time of battle, Lord blessed Him with a victory because of his faithfulness. When a poor widow at Zarephath was faithful in the little she had, the Lord   blessed her and provided for her needs.God is calling on us to be faithful   similarly.

            <br>
          Do you worship God? Many people will say yes, but their   worship is without a true knowledge of the God whom they worship. Paul say that in Athens and preached the living God. Only when you know whom you worship is   your worship meaningful.

            <br>
          Jesus said, "God is spirit and those who worship Him   must worship him in spirit and in truth." Many worshippers today stop with   physical acts of worship without a deeper connection with God in the spirit realm. God exhorts us to get into that deeper level of worshipping Him in spirit and in truth!

            <br>
          God is to be worshipped in holiness. Seraphim   worshipped the holiness of the Lord and Isaiah was reminded of his own   unworthiness before the most holy God. In your life, as you worship Him, you   should worship Him in holiness that you can only get through the atoning   sacrifice of Jesus Christ at the cross!

            <br>
          How should we worship God? Many today have a casual   outlook to worshipping the Lord God. But the Bible teaches us to worship the   Lord with fear and trembling. Not veing scared of our wits, but with awe and   reverence, we should worship God. Fear of the Lord should lead our lives and our   actions and culminate in a meaningful worship of the Lord!

            <br>
          </A>When you accept the Lord Jesus Christ, God establishes   His eternal covenant with you formed with love and grace. By His mercy, He   defends you and blesses you. However, many do not remember the covenant and do   not wlak in that covenant. Return to your place of covenant today and you will   see the hands of the Lord move mightily in your life. Hallelujah!
