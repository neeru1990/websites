"There are ten people who are very close to my heart. They are the architects of this championship. These magnificent ten are Luca Montezemolo (President), he is not only the boss of our team, but also its heart; Jean Todt (General Manager), a true friend of mine and Corrina (Schumacher's wife); Ross Brawn (Technical Director), our super-brain in the command post; Rory Byrne (Chief Designer), he has tailored a car for me; Luca Baldisseri (His Race Engineer), the man for my car, always at my side; Ignazio Lunetta (Chief Engineer), a man with incredible experience; Pino D'Agostino (Engineer), nobody sings the Italian Anthem with more fervour!; Paolo Martinelli (Engine Technical Director), an extremely precise and technical man; Stefano Domenicali (Team Manager), our organisational talent, and Willi Weber, my manager."
