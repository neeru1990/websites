    <td class="content"><p>NeoTechID Warehouse  Management System is a comprehensive tool that can provide complete end-to-end  management and visibility of the order fulfillment process. This includes  integration of Order Processing, Inventory &amp; Warehouse functions, Transport  Planning, Document Generation etc in terms of a workflow based system with  defined underlying dependencies between operations.</p>
      <p>The system provides  warehouse supervisors a consolidated view of outbound delivery operations as  well. It involves monitoring stuffing of cargo into containers/loading on lorries,  tally sheet confirmations/verifications, delivery note confirmations etc. It  may also extend to outbound mobility for location-based track-&amp;-trace and  e-confirmation for each delivery.</p>
      <h6>Some salient features  are as follows:<br />
      </h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Materials can be transferred between locations in  the warehouse.</li>
        <li>Items are verified real-time and transfer can be  posted.</li>
        <li>Inter-warehouse transfer can be easily traced and  ensure the inventory status is available real-time.</li>
        <li>The management will have a better visibility of  inventory levels, thus reducing excessive stock in the warehouse.</li>
        <li>Materials can be verified immediately, preventing  human errors and time-consuming manual reconciliation.</li>
        <li>Simple inventory management functions are available  in the system. </li>
        <li>Goods receipt, Goods Issue, and inventory levels  are captured and can be retrieved any time. The system does not interface to  any ERP system.</li>
        <li>Advanced Picking and Put Away strategies are  empowered by real-time data collection. This allows for the effective management  of the materials flow in the Warehouse.</li>
        <li>Re-arrangement of existing stock (based on demand  data) is supported with data collected from warehouse operations.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h6>NeoTechID WMS also  broadly covers the following functions:</h6>
      <h6 style="font-weight: bold">Inbound Operations: </h6>
      <ul>
        <li>User is able to perform Goods Receive (GR) against  purchase order/Advanced Shipment Notification (ASN).</li>
        <li>Items &amp; quantity are verified and GR can be  posted immediately. </li>
        <li>Real-time information is captured.</li>
        <li>Data can be captured live after performing Quality Check  (QC), which speeds up collection of data.</li>
        <li>There is no need to wait for the staff to return to  office and do system updates.</li>
        <li>After GR, the system directs the Put Away process.  You can confirm PA location / make location changes via the system. </li>
        <li>The option of a Vehicle Mount Terminal enables forklift  drivers to be guided by system-directed processes and relay data collected  real-time.</li>
      </ul>
      <h6 style="font-weight: bold">Inventory Operations: </h6>
      <ul>
        <li>At the receiving end, the system can be triggered  to look for and fetch the ASN for reconciliation and update WMS.</li>
        <li>Upon GR, the system triggers label printing for GR  and Put Away information. Information like GR number, PO number, GR date, Parts  Number, Quantity etc can be printed.</li>
        <li>The information can also be barcoded/RFID Encoded  for data capturing during picking, stock take, cycle count etc.</li>
        <li>The system also allows the user to perform Goods Issue  (GI) against a delivery order. Items &amp; quantity are verified online and GI  can be posted. Real-time information is captured.</li>
        <li>A Hand Held Terminal (HHT) is used to confirm the  picking process. In this way, you can track the progress of each order  fulfillment.</li>
        <li>Special instructions and packing information stored  in the backend system can be accessed through the HHT.</li>
        <li>The HHT is also used to inspect and check the goods  for staging, eliminating errors.</li>
      </ul>
      <h6 style="font-weight: bold">Outbound Operations:      </h6>
      <ul>
        <li>At the shipping end, the system can verify if the  right goods goes into the right containers/trucks.</li>
