Dearly beloved in Christ:
</p>
<p>
Greetings to you in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 
</p>
<p>
As you might have been following up on the news, a great calamity has struck South East Asia. A giant earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale struck beneath the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, an Island near Indonesia on Dec 26th. The quake sent giant tidal Tsunami waves across thousands of miles of coastal regions in several countries including Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and Malaysia. Several houses have been destroyed, cars carried away into water and several people have died. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 currently and officials state that it is bound to rise. The real death toll of this tragedy many never be found out according to an UN official. Property damage is estimated to top billions of dollars. Millions are left homeless. Dead and decomposing carcasses are creating a heavy stench in the affected areas and pose a high risk of disease outbreak. Families have lost loved ones and in many cases lost all they had and are forced to start all over. Many towns have been totally evacuated and the tragedy is beyond words.
</p>
<p>
We need to respond to this time of need and do the needful to send relief to the people affected, reflecting the love and compassion of our Lord Jesus Christ. Power of Gospel ministries is working to provide financial support to relief efforts by partnering with Christian ministries in India and Sri Lanka in this hour of need. Our desire is to reflect the heart of Christ to those in need. 
</p>
<p>
We are not focusing to provide short term needs such as medicine, and shelter which are already being provided by the government and many international relief organizations. Our focus is to help start the families in the path to rehabilitation. In Chennai, we are working with an Assembly of God Church that has identified families who have lost everything. These families are being provided assistance for rehabilitation. Majority of these families are fishermen. They are being provided stoves, basic clothing and utensils at this time. We are also looking into providing fishing nets to fishermen families so that they can have their livelihood back. 
</p>
<p>
In Sri Lanka, we are working with an Evangelical ministry to provide assistance for impacted families. We are looking at providing stoves and utensils for them. The community we are targeting has had sewing as a predominant cottage industry. We are looking to providing sewing machines to the families who have lost them in the Tsunami, to get them back to earning for their families. Besides families, several churches have been damaged in the Tsunami and they need help to repair.
</p>
<p>
The need is great and we pray that the Lord would enable us to help in whatever way possible. We invite you to share the love of God through your financial support for this relief effort. All funds collected for this purpose will be sent to the Tsunami relief effort only and not used for any other ministry activities. You can send checks drawn in favor of “Power of Gospel Ministries” indicating “Tsunami relief” in the memo to the following address.
