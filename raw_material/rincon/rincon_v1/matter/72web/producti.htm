            prepare, print, stuff and mail or manually fax a single document.
            This process costs more than a dollar every time. Now multiply that
            by the thousands of documents that your back-office applications
            generate everyday. Then consider RightFAX. By implementing a
            RightFAX production system, you can delivery that same document
            instantaneously and reliably for about 10 cents. The savings over
            time can be substantial.</font>

              production-level electronic document delivery. With RightFAX
              Filter for Production, companies do not need to modify the data
