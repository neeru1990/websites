alt="tr1034_250w.jpg (14106 bytes)">Brooktrout Technology is the market leader in
intelligent fax technology, having pioneered the LAN Fax market in 1987. The TR1034&#153;
product line is the latest generation of intelligent fax boards from Brooktrout
Technology, and offers enterprise customers a line of 33.6Kbps intelligent fax boards with
high performance fax capabilities for a variety of computer-based fax applications, such
as network fax, fax broadcast, unified messaging, and business process automation.</p>

<p>The TR1034 is offered in a variety of configurations, compatible with all 33MHz and
66MHz PCI slots, for the ultimate in flexibility, allowing customers to grow into their
fax solution and increase the number of ports as their requirements dictate. For customers
requiring a medium density digital fax solution, the TR1034 is available in 8 or 16
channel configurations for fractional T1, or 8, 10, 16 or 20 channel configurations for
fractional E1. For customers who require a higher density fax solution, the TR1034 is
available in 24 or 30 channel configurations per board with onboard T1/E1 interface.</p>

<p>The TR1034 board has all the renowned functionality that has made Brooktrout the
leading provider of intelligent fax boards like Brooktrout&#146;s Adaptive Call Progress,
Error Correction Mode, MMR fax compression, plus offers additional capabilities and value
with 33.6Kbps transmission rates. The TR1034 sends and receives faxes up to 33.6Kbps based
on the V.34 fax standard. Not only can the TR1034 process fax at twice the speed of
14.4Kbps fax boards, it also supports V.8 fast handshaking, which can cut call setup and
session-management time by one-third. In the end, a fax document that takes 1 minute with
a 14.4K intelligent fax board can now be sent in less than 30 seconds with the TR1034. The
TR1034 board delivers unmatched call completion at the fastest possible connection rates
across a wide variety of fax machines and line conditions.</p>

<p>Unparalleled performance, carrier-grade reliability, single-slot footprint, onboard
T1/E1 and the flexibility to adapt to changing needs, all contribute to reducing the
overall cost of ownership, simplifying installation, minimizing ongoing management, and
providing the highest level of dependable performance. An onboard T1/E1 interface
minimizes space requirements, and the small footprint allows higher system densities for
installations and greater flexibility in leveraging multi-purpose servers in enterprise
installations.</p>

<p>Developers can create fax applications using the Brooktrout Technology Fax and Voice
Application Programming Interface (Bfv API), a powerful tool for sophisticated application
development. High-level functions permit programmers to quickly create applications. Lower
level functions permit direct interactions with individual elements of fax and voice
calls.</p>

<p>The TR1034 line of fax boards offers customers a complete V.34 fax platform with all
the performance and reliability that made Brooktrout a world leader in intelligent fax.
The TR1034 is a single slot fax card that supports the V.34 standard, delivering fast
33.6Kbps fax transmission speeds, with 8&#150;30 fax channels per board, and features an
onboard T1/E1 interface. For customers, this delivers significant transmission cost
savings, increased service capacity, and full interoperability with the growing installed
base of V.34 fax machines.</p>
