<p align="left">Analog phone lines are the most basic means of fax transmission available
today. Analog lines do not offer the high-performance of digital (e.g. ISDN) lines. Even
so, analog lines may be the most appropriate and cost-effective choice for small- and
medium-sized businesses with moderate fax requirements. </p>

<p>When ordering analog lines from your local tele-phone company, you may select either
&quot;DID&quot; (Direct Inward Dial) or &quot;Loop Start&quot; analog lines; this will
determine the type of faxing you will be able to do: 

<ol>
  <li>Loop Start lines provide inbound or outbound faxing with manual inbound routing to the
    desktop. (Requires Loop Start TR114 boards) </li>
  <li>DID lines provide inbound only faxing with auto routing to each desktop. (Requires DID
    TR114 boards) </li>
  <li>For both inbound and outbound faxing with auto routing, connect DID and Loop Start lines
    to a mix of DID and Loop Start TR114 intelligent fax boards. Or, select a
    &quot;Combination&quot; DID and Loop Start TR114 analog fax board with both DID and Loop
    Start channels. </li>
</ol>
