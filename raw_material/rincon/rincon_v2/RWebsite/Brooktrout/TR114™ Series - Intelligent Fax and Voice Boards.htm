<h4 align="left"><b>Multichannel, Universal Port&#153; Power for New Network Fax and Voice
Applications</b></h4>

<p align="left">Brooktrout Technology's TR114&#153; Series of intelligent fax and voice
boards have long been known as the &quot;top of the line&quot; for Computer Telephony
applications including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Network faxing </li>
  <li>Broadcast fax services </li>
  <li>Fax-on-demand </li>
  <li>Interactive voice response </li>
  <li>And more </li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left"><b>Advantages of Intelligent Fax Boards vs. Class 2 Fax Modems </b></h4>

<ul>
  <li>Server savings: Class 2 modems, because of the overhead associated with document
    conversion, can push the limit of PC server processing power with as few as two to four
    ports. In contrast, intelligent fax boards can support up to 96 ports per server. The
    upshot: past two to four ports, an additional hidden cost of Class 2 ports can be the
    purchase of additional PCs. </li>
  <li>More overseas faxing: Because overseas phone rates are higher, if one sends more than 1
    of every 8 faxes overseas, greater savings will result from intelligent fax board use than
    is shown below. </li>
  <li>Intangibles: Intelligent fax boards enjoy a higher call completion rate, so less labor
    is exerted to track down and handle failed call attempts. Productivity increases are
    greater because more people use intelligent fax board-based fax systems more often. Crises
    don't occur when workers arrive at the office in the morning to find that 70 faxes out of
    a 400-site fax broadcast were never actually sent. </li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left"><b>Cost Model Assumptions</b></h4>

<ul>
  <li>A four port fax server is used to send 160 4-page faxes per day (considered a mid-volume
    load), 260 days per year. </li>
  <li>Of the 160 daily faxes, 16 are local and essentially free, 24 are &quot;local&quot;
    long-distance ($0.15/minute), 104 are long-distance ($0.06/minute), and 16 are
    international ($0.35/minute). </li>
  <li>The performance penalties of Class 2 modems (e.g. poor signal-to-noise ratio, prolonged
    &quot;handshaking,&quot; re-sending of failed call attempts) are conservatively assumed to
    add only 5% to Class 2 calling time. </li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Universal PCI (uPCI)</b></h4>

<p align="left"><font color="black"><img height="155" hspace="5"

width="100" align="left"></font>Universal PCI (uPCI) is the ability to plug a Brooktrout
intelligent fax board into either a 3.3V or 5V bus slot in a server chassis. A board that
is uPCI will be physically &#145;keyed&#146; for both 3.3V and 5V bus slots. That is,
there will be a second notch in the PCI connector on the board. The 3.3V notch will be on
the left of the connector, closer to the card bracket than the 5V notch (which is on the
right). </p>

<p>Brooktrout&#146;s TruFax, TR114 Loop Start, TR114 BRI, TR114 DID, TR114 Combo
(Loop/DID), and TR1034 fax cards are all Universal PCI compatible (per PCI-SIG
Specification 2.3). All Brooktrout uPCI cards at present are 32-bit, 33MHz, 3.3V/5V
universal connector cards. These cards will work in servers that have the following PCI
bus slot characteristics <em>up to and including</em>: 

<ul>
  <li>64-bit connector </li>
  <li>133MHz bus clock speed </li>
  <li>3.3V-only bus slots </li>
  <li>3.3V-only slot signaling </li>
</ul>
