<h4 align="left"><b>Dependable Fax Performance for Small Businesses and Low Volume Fax
Customers</b></h4>

<p align="left"><font color="black"><img height="155" hspace="5"
src="TruFax®/server2003_100x155.gif" width="100" align="left">Brooktrout Technology is
the market leader in Intelligent Fax technology, having pioneered the category in 1994.
Acquired from over a decade of experience, Brooktrout&#146;s TruFax Series has a built in
library of communication techniques that identify and adapt to the various implementations
of real world fax machines and line conditions. This technical formula, TruFax&#146;s
Adaptive Call Progress ensures unparalleled levels of compatibility, high rates of
connectivity and high overall transmission speeds. Brooktrout&#146;s TruFax® Series is a
line of intelligent fax boards that offer small to medium-sized businesses and
departmental workgroups dependable fax capabilities for a variety of computer based fax
applications, such as network fax and fax broadcast. The TruFax Series offers a level of
reliability and fax performance that businesses can depend on at an economical price point
for low volume fax traffic. Unlike Class 1 and Class 2 fax modems, TruFax&#146;s advanced
fax algorithms, dedicated fax processing components, and a single-purpose design delivers
the performance that enterprise fax applications require.</font></p>

<p>TruFax offers Adaptive Call Progress algorithms to ensure high connectivity rates and
transmissions speeds across a wide range of fax machines and telephone line conditions. It
is the same Intelligent Fax technology used in Brooktrout&#146;s high-end, market leading
TR114&#153; and TR1034&#153; Series. TruFax processes the fax protocol onboard, thereby
lowering the CPU utilization of the server and improving overall system performance.
Designed purposely to support fax-only modulation, TruFax provides a high level of network
security from unauthorized data call attempts.</p>

<p>The TruFax 100 one-channel fax board is for customers who have minimal faxing
requirements, but still require a highly reliable and dependable solution. The TruFax 200
two-channel fax board is recommended for use with a network fax solution. By configuring
the board to send and receive faxes through separate channels, the fax solution is always
prepared to receive faxes in one channel while the other channel is occupied sending faxes
from the outbound job queue.</p>

<h4><b>Universal PCI (uPCI)</b></h4>

<p align="left">Universal PCI (uPCI) is the ability to plug a Brooktrout intelligent fax
board into either a 3.3V or 5V bus slot in a server chassis. A board that is uPCI will be
physically &#145;keyed&#146; for both 3.3V and 5V bus slots. That is, there will be a
second notch in the PCI connector on the board. The 3.3V notch will be on the left of the
connector, closer to the card bracket than the 5V notch (which is on the right). </p>

<p>Brooktrout&#146;s TruFax, TR114 Loop Start, TR114 BRI, TR114 DID, TR114 Combo
(Loop/DID), and TR1034 fax cards are all Universal PCI compatible (per PCI-SIG
Specification 2.3). All Brooktrout uPCI cards at present are 32-bit, 33MHz, 3.3V/5V
universal connector cards. These cards will work in servers that have the following PCI
bus slot characteristics <em>up to and including</em>:<br>
- 64-bit connector<br>
- 133MHz bus clock speed<br>
- 3.3V-only bus slots<br>
- 3.3V-only slot signaling </p>
