    <strong><a name="b1"></a>What is Unified Messaging?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Unified Messaging is the ability to access all types of messages using the terminal of
    your choice&#151;telephone and computer. Take control of your messages before your
    messages take control of you.<br>
    <br>
    Today's businesses are continually inundated with a multitude of ways to communicate
    information&#151;voice mail, fax, and electronic mail. And chances are, your company uses
    all three. But as the pace of business increases, so does the number of all types of
    messages, until enough voice, fax, and email messages are processed that the technology
    actually slows you down.<br>
    <br>
    The need for efficient ways to communicate information has resulted in a number of
    different messaging mediums. Each message type has its own advantages and disadvantages
    and each requires a different terminal device for delivery and access&#151;the telephone
    or computer. However, as the number of voice, fax, and email messages grows, so does the
    need for an improved way of managing them using a common set of management tools from a
    single terminal device.<br>
    <br>
    Captaris unified messaging applications allow you to access all of your
    messages&#151;voice mail, fax and email&#151;from the terminal device of your choice. You
    have more efficient access to your messages when you're in the office, and more flexible
    access when you're on the road. And that makes you more productive no matter where you
    are. <br>
    <br>
    <font size="1"><a href="#top">Back to the topics</a></font> <br>
    <br>
    <strong><a name="b2"></a>How does it work?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Unified messaging provides a single point of access to all three message types voice, fax,
    and email from virtually any communications device telephone, personal computer or Web
    browser through the Internet. In the user's familiar email inbox, a unique icon identifies
    each message type. This single point of access and control increases employee productivity
    while improving communications with both customers and co-workers.<br>
    <br>
    When out of the office or on the road, users can access and manage all their messages
    through the Telephone User Interface (TUI). Using the TUI, an employee can dial into their
    unified messaging system from any telephone and be able to quickly and efficiently listen
    to and respond to any message waiting in their inbox. They will be able to access and
    manage all three-message types voice, fax, and email with just one phone call. The user
    can listen to their email messages using text-to-speech technology and respond to that
    email message with a voice message. The user can listen to the header of their fax
    message, forward that message to someone else, or even print it to the closest fax
    machine.<br>
    <br>
    When in the office or on the road with a laptop, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) allows
    users to view all their messages, voice, fax, and email from their desktop computer or by
    dialing into the network using an Internet connection.<br>
    <br>
    Unified messaging provides professionals with more flexibility when traveling, improves
    employee productivity while in the office and on the road, and gives companies the
    competitive edge they're looking for. <br>
    <font size="1"><br>
    <a href="#top">Back to the topics</a></font><br>
    <br>
    <strong><a name="b3"></a>Benefits of Unified Messaging:</strong><br>
    <br>
    In today's business environment, professionals are constantly bombarded with time and
    mission-critical information, most of which comes in the form of email, voice and fax
    messages. An employee's ability to handle and respond to these messages can mean the
    difference between a company that effectively communicates with its key audience, and one
    that is out of touch with those most critical to its success.<br>
    <br>
    A recent study published in the Wall Street Journal found that the average employee sends
    and receives more than 200 messages per day. As a result, a substantial amount of their
    workday is spent managing this information, rather than using it to their advantage. As
    telecommuters, traveling and off-site employees become more common, companies are also
    struggling with the need to keep these &quot;road warriors,&quot; or mobile professionals,
    informed and in touch.<br>
    <br>
    In order to maintain a competitive edge and help their employees be more productive, many
    companies are turning to unified messaging. This communications tool increases
    productivity, facilitates mobility, and gives companies the competitive advantage they are
    looking for. <br>
    <font size="1"><br>
    <a href="#top">Back to the topics</a></font><br>
    <br>
    <strong><a name="b4"></a>Features and Benefits for the Mobile Professional:</strong><br>
    <br>
    Some unified messaging products include specific features tailor-made for the &quot;road
    warrior,&quot; but that benefits all users whether they are in or out of the office. One
    such feature captures a caller's ANI (caller ID) and enables the user to respond to a
    voice message with a live telephone call. This powerful feature allows an employee to
    retrieve messages from any telephone and with the press of a button, be directly connected
    to the person who left the message.<br>
    <br>
    Another unified messaging feature that caters to the mobile professional is the ability to
    send a voice reply to an email message. When using a telephone to retrieve messages, users
    can listen to an email message using text-to-speech, choose the reply option, and record a
    voice response. That voice message will be attached as a standard .wav file to a reply
    email message and sent to the original message sender. This feature allows the mobile
    worker to access and respond to email messages from any telephone, eliminating the need to
    have access to a computer in order to retrieve and respond to email messages.<br>
    <br>
    Anyone who has ever played &quot;phone tag&quot; will appreciate what is commonly known as
    the &quot;Find Me, Follow Me&quot; unified messaging feature. Find Me, Follow Me allows
    the user to determine the path a call will take to try to reach them. This feature can be
    customized to try any combination of different phone numbers in order to insure that
    important call is not missed.<br>
    <br>
    For example, if a user is going to be out of the office, but is waiting for an important
    call, he or she can specify that if no one picks up at the office, unified messaging will
    try his or her cell phone, then a pager, then home. If no one picks up at home, the caller
    will be transferred into voicemail.<br>
    <br>
    Similar to Find Me, Follow Me is the unified messaging feature Short Message Service
    (SMS). With SMS, the user is notified on the alphanumeric display of their cell phone that
    they have a message waiting for them in their inbox. If it is an email message, a small
    amount of text, the sender and the time the message arrived is all included on the
    display. If it is a voice message, the user can view the caller ID and time the message
    was received. SMS notifies the user of a fax message by including the number of pages and
    the time the fax was received. Users can also specify that they only want SMS to notify
    them of a message if it is urgent or from a particular person such as their manager or
    team member. <br>
    <font size="1"><br>
    <a href="#top">Back to the topics</a></font><br>
    <br>
    <strong><a name="b5"></a>Return on Investment:</strong><br>
    <br>
    The increased productivity, time-savings and flexibility of unified messaging translate
    into valuable cost savings. A recent industry study published by Comgroup, an independent
    telecommunications consulting firm, and Captaris Corp. measured effects of unified
    messaging on time savings and productivity. The study found that by utilizing unified
    messaging, mobile users experienced a time savings gain of 70 percent when compared to the
    traditional means of checking messages. The first facet of the study compared users who
    were able to review and manage all of their voice, fax, and email messages over the
    telephone using unified messaging with those who check messages on the road the
    conventional way by calling in over the telephone to listen to voice messages; calling an
    assistant at the main office to send faxes to the nearest fax machine; and connecting to
    the Internet with a laptop computer to download and check emails. One important point to
    note is that with unified messaging, mobile employees always have access to all of their
    messages at anytime. However, with the traditional means of retrieving messages on the
    road, users must often rely on in-office personnel for some messaging tasks such as
    forwarding a fax.<br>
    <br>
    Office workers also gain significant and measurable time savings by having all voice, fax,
    and email messages displayed in a single interface. According to the study, users
    experienced a 53 percent time-savings using unified messaging to check all of their
    messages from within their familiar Lotus Notes and Microsoft Outlook interface, as
    opposed to the traditional means of checking voice messages over the telephone, fax
    messages at the fax machine, and emails at the desktop PC.<br>
    <br>
    Perhaps the greatest time savings associated with unified messaging is realized through
    the desktop faxing application. Many employees spend a large part of their day, going back
    and forth between their desk and the central fax machine; standing in line to send a fax;
    checking on that fax to make sure it went through; or checking to see if the fax they are
    waiting for has arrived. The study found that deploying desktop faxing with a unified
    messaging system resulted in a 80 percent time savings compared to traditional means of
    sending a document from a stand-alone fax machine.<br>
    <br>
    While some IT managers worry that they cannot afford to deploy unified messaging within
    their company, the study found that an average size system pays for itself in 68 business
    days. <br>
    <font size="1"><br>
    <a href="#top">Back to the topics</a></font><br>
    <br>
    <strong><a name="b6"></a>Ease of Administration:</strong><br>
    <br>
    In addition to increased productivity, time and cost savings, unified messaging can also
    make the life of an IT administrator much easier. Having an open standards-based platform
    without a proprietary user interface is the key to any system administrator. Not only is
    the graphical environment familiar, the system is simple to manage because it's based upon
    standard systems the company already knows and owns. A complete unified messaging solution
    will also provide the end user with the choice of either client or server based unified
    messaging. With client based unified messaging, messages are stored on both the email and
    voice mail server. Where as with server based unified messaging, messages are collected in
    a universal store. There are advantages and disadvantages with each style of integration,
    however, the end user should be given a choice so that they can configure the system so
    that it is tailored to their needs.<br>
    <br>
    Paramount to a successful messaging network is the ability to maintain up-to-date and
    accurate user data on each node in the network. Certain unified messaging solutions
    include a feature that eliminates this challenge by automatically synchronizing user and
    server data across the Internet. This enhancement dramatically reduces the maintenance
    tasks for the system administrator and ensures all users across all locations are able to
    seamlessly communicate as easily as if they were in the same location. <br>
