    <td><strong>Q. How does RightFax work with the Xerox Document Centre?</strong> <p>A. Using
    RightFax with the Document Centre, users have both easy walk-up access and a single,
    central point of control for electronic and hard copy faxing. Working in conjunction with
    a RightFax server, Document Centre users no longer need to maintain stand-alone fax
    machines or dedicated phone lines or modems for individual workstations. Instead, they can
    easily send and receive faxes directly from the Document Centre on their network with
    RightFax and take advantage of cost-saving features such as Intelligent Least-Cost
    Routing&#153;, as well as a list of other capabilities such as inbound routing, advanced
    notifications, and easy fax management. </p>
    <p><strong>Q. How does outbound faxing work?</strong> </p>
    <p>A. Xerox hardware/software captures paper documents and integrates them electronically
    into the RightFax server. The user programs the fax job using the touch screen user
    interface, presses the green button and scans in a document to be faxed. The Document
    Centre converts the document into a TIFF file and attaches the fax instructions. The TIFF
    file is sent to the RightFax server. RightFax software converts the TIFF to CCITT GIV and
    transmits the document. A transmission report can be sent from the RightFax server to the
    Document Centre and printed. </p>
    <p><strong>Q. How does inbound faxing work?</strong> </p>
    <p>A. An incoming fax arrives at the RightFax server where it can be sent to any Document
    Centre on the network and received in the normal queue as an incoming print job where it
    can be printed or routed electronically for distribution and retrieval. </p>
