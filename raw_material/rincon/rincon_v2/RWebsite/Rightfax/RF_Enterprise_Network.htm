    Fax technology is as vital a part of business-to-business communications as the telephone
    and electricity are part of our everyday lives. With its ease of use, immediacy of
    delivery and universal accessibility, fax has earned worldwide acceptance. Fax is no
    longer considered a convenience, but rather integral to doing business. And Captaris
    RightFax is the worldwide choice. As fax technology evolves into total e-document
    delivery, RightFax remains at the forefront. <p><strong>Putting You in Control of
    Electronic Document Delivery</strong> </p>
    <p>RightFax delivers critical business documents where you want, when you want. Reliably.
    Economically. Securely.</p>
    <p>In today&#146;s fast-paced, wired and wireless world, businesses are looking for faster
    and more efficient ways to:<ul>
      <li>Integrate systems to enhance communications and improve productivity </li>
      <li>Connect to customers, suppliers, partners and employees </li>
      <li>Leverage enterprise-wide information systems and applications </li>
    </ul>
    <p>RightFax solutions provide companies with a centralized infrastructure for
    mission-critical document delivery, which can be used across the enterprise. And since the
    RightFax server and client are certified by Microsoft, you can be assured of higher
    reliability and lower cost of ownership. Certification ensures that applications meet all
    the requirements of the Microsoft Application Specification for Windows 2000. The end
    result is an application that is easier to install, maintain, and manage. Although
    thousands of applications are fully compatible with Microsoft operating systems, only
    select vendors like Captaris have elected to have their application rigorously tested
    against the exacting set of standards set by Microsoft to ensure that they are secure,
    manageable and run reliably in these environments. </p>
