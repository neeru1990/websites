    <td><strong>Have You Considered All Your Options?</strong><br>
    Ask yourself the following questions about your current faxing habits: <ul>
      <li>Are busy periods on your fax server unpredictable? </li>
      <li>Are your fax communications disabled if your phone lines go down? </li>
      <li>Do fax broadcasts applications ever cause congestion for your other fax traffic? </li>
      <li>Do you have a need for high-volume delivery within a matter of minutes? </li>
      <li>Are you currently outsourcing faxing in any other departments? </li>
      <li>Are your international sites paying high tariffs to deliver to the US? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you answered &quot;yes&quot; to any of these questions, you will appreciate the
    RightFax IP Plus<sup>&#153;</sup> Connector and Services. </p>
    <p>This product offers you an alternative delivery method so you can create a hybrid fax
    solution that combines the control and flexibility of your existing RightFax server with
    the virtual capacity and high-volume delivery of the Captaris <u>MediaLinq</u> outbound
    fax network. </p>
    <p><strong>How Can the IP Plus Service Benefit Your Organization?<br>
    </strong>Because faxing via IP Plus is controlled by RightFax dialing rules, you have
    virtually limitless flexibility in how and when you use the service. Here are just a few
    of the IP Plus applications that can add power, flexibility, and security to your
    organization&#146;s e-document delivery: </p>
    <p><strong>Sending occasional large-scale fax broadcasts<br>
    </strong>The IP Plus service is ideal for handling your organization&#146;s fax
    broadcasts. For many organizations it is impractical to install enough fax ports to handle
    only periodic increases in fax traffic or to deliver a large number of faxes in a short
    period of time. Offloading your fax broadcasts to the IP Plus service not only ensures
    that your local fax channels will remain free for normal fax traffic, it also gives you
    access to thousands of virtual fax ports for very fast transmission, even to very large
    distribution lists. </p>
    <p><strong>Using IP Plus to handle unexpected fax traffic overload on the server<br>
    </strong>If your fax server experiences occasional increases in fax volume that result in
    delays in fax transmission, the IP Plus service can be configured to automatically pick up
    the extra traffic and ensure that all your organization&#146;s faxes are sent on time.
    Special dialing rules can be configured that tell your fax server to route faxes via IP
    Plus only when the fax queue depth reaches the limit you specify. </p>
    <p><strong>Using IP Plus as a backup in case of fax board or phone line failures<br>
    </strong>Even if your server has enough fax channels installed to handle all possible fax
    volume increases, unexpected phone line problems or scheduled switch maintenance can put
    an immediate stop to all your organization&#146;s incoming and outgoing fax traffic.
    RightFax can be configured to automatically divert all fax traffic to IP Plus via the
    Internet when it detects that your fax channels are off-line. </p>
    <p><strong>Using IP Plus to reduce phone charges<br>
    </strong>Long distance charges incurred when faxing internationally are often
    significantly higher on a per-page basis than the cost of the IP Plus service,
    particularly when faxing from international locations to the U.S. This cost savings is
    substantially magnified as your fax volume increases. Your RightFax representative will be
    happy to help you compare your international fax expenses to the cost of equivalent IP
    Plus service. </p>
    <p><strong>How Does the IP Plus Service Work?<br>
    </strong>When you sign up for the IP Plus service, you are provided an account number and
    passcode. You can set up one IP Plus account, or multiple IP Plus accounts for different
    departments or groups in your organization. Each account represents a fixed number of fax
    pages that can be sent via IP Plus. As you send faxes, your account balance is
    decremented. </p>
    <p>Each IP Plus account is set up and configured in Enterprise Fax Manager. Each
    account&#146;s configuration includes the account number and passcode as well as
    information on how to connect to the IP Plus server via the Internet. </p>
    <p>Once your IP Plus account has been configured in Enterprise Fax Manager, the RightFax
    administrator creates custom dialing rules that will automatically route specified
    outbound fax traffic to the IP Plus service for transmission. </p>
    <p><strong>IP Plus Service System Requirements</strong><br>
    In order to use the RightFax IP Plus service, your RightFax server and network must meet
    these specifications: <ul>
      <li>Faxes must originate on a RightFax v7.0 server (or higher). Faxes originating on a
        pre-7.0 RightFax server and then routed to a 7.0 or higher server for delivery via IP Plus
        will be sent via local channels. </li>
      <li>The RightFax server must have a 128 kb (or better) ISDN connection. </li>
      <li>The IP Plus Connector must be configured with a valid IP Plus service account number and
        passcode, and the account must have a sufficient fax page balance to complete the job. </li>
    </ul>
