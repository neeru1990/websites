    <td><p align="justify"><strong>Q. What is the RightFax Gateway for Lotus Notes?</strong> </p>
    <p align="justify">A. The RightFax Gateway for Lotus Notes is an optional module that
    links Lotus Notes with RightFax desktop fax features, creating a fully unified fax and
    email solution. The gateway uses RightFax to enable inbound and outbound faxing directly
    from the Notes client. Notes users need virtually no training to send and receive faxes,
    because they&#146;ll use Notes in the same way they would send and receive emails.
    Database synchronization between Lotus Notes/Domino and RightFax allows unified
    administration of both servers. </p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>Q. How does the Gateway for Lotus Notes work?</strong> </p>
    <p align="justify">A. RightFax makes sending and receiving fax documents as simple for
    users as using Notes mail. Faxes can be addressed to one or more destinations, including
    mixed fax and email addresses, using a simple dialog. Advanced fax functionality is
    available to expand and simplify the process of sending faxes via Notes, all without
    modifications to the Notes mail template. Giving users tools to work within their familiar
    Notes environment reduces training time and streamlines communications processes. </p>
    <p align="justify">When a user faxes a document from Notes, the gateway delivers the
    document to the RightFax server. RightFax renders the document to fax format, including
    several native file types, adds a cover sheet or any specified library document, and then
    transmits the document. The RightFax Gateway for Lotus Notes also automatically routes
    incoming faxes as mail messages to Notes mail databases. </p>

    document to the RightFax server. RightFax renders the document to fax format, including
    several native file types, adds a cover sheet or any specified library document, and then
    transmits the document over phone lines, an intranet or the Internet. </p>
    <p align="justify">The RightFax Gateway for Lotus Notes also automatically routes incoming
    faxes as mail messages to Notes mail databases. Custom icons let users easily identify
    draft, sent, and received fax messages in their Notes mail. The fax image itself is saved
    as a file attachment in a Notes mail message. To view the fax, the user simply
    double-clicks the attachment icon. </p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>Q. How does administration of the Gateway work?</strong> </p>
    <p align="justify">A. RightFax offers the most sophisticated integration with Lotus Notes,
    providing Notes administrators with a comprehensive feature set that lets users perform
    virtually every fax function from the familiar Notes mail interface. Since the gateway is
    installed at the server, there is no need to install additional software on each desktop
    and no need for additional training. </p>
    <p align="justify">For Notes administrators, RightFax boasts native Notes installation and
    on-demand synchronization. Providing complete administrative autonomy, RightFax allows
    Notes administrators to access and modify RightFax settings and configuration options from
    directly within Notes. With this built-in efficiency, fax administration becomes
    effortless. </p>
