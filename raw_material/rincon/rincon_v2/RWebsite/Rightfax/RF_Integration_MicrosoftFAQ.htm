    <td><strong>Q. Is the Microsoft and Captaris partnership certified?</strong> <p>A. Yes. As
    a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, Captaris is one of an elite group that is proven to
    provide world-class Microsoft solutions. RightFax 8.0 is certified on Windows 2000 Server
    and Advanced Server, including support for Windows Cluster Server and RightFax is Windows
    XP compliant. Certification provides application reliability, continuity in the user
    interface experience, and ease of installation and ongoing operation. Applications that
    are certified on Windows 2000 have gone through a rigorous third-party testing process to
    ensure conformance with Microsoft application requirement specifications. Reliability and
    decreased cost of ownership make certified applications a preferred choice. </p>
    <p>Conformance with Microsoft guidelines ensures the smooth operation of the RightFax
    server and reduces any risk of downtime that may be experienced with uncertified products.
    Certification on Windows 2000 Advanced Server takes this a step further by providing
    assurance that the RightFax server works in a Microsoft clustering environment. </p>
    <p>The RightFax client has also been certified on Windows 2000 Professional. These
    certifications show our level of commitment to reliability and providing enterprise-class
    solutions. </p>
    <p><strong>Q. How does RightFax integrate with Microsoft Exchange?</strong> </p>
    <p>A. The RightFax Gateway for Microsoft Exchange consists of four components that work
    together to allow inbound and outbound faxing via email, user database synchronization and
    unified administration. </p>
    <p><strong>RightFax Gateway</strong> </p>
    <p>This component is responsible for converting email messages to fax format and
    delivering them to the RightFax server for processing. The Gateway also directs incoming
    faxes to the RightFax connector for processing by Microsoft Exchange. </p>
    <p><strong>RightFax Connector</strong> </p>
    <p>This service, which is installed and runs on the Microsoft Exchange server, handles all
    messaging between the Microsoft and RightFax servers. If running Exchange 5.5, the
    Connector also handles synchronization of user databases. The RightFax Connector can be
    configured through the Microsoft Management Console. </p>
    <p><strong>The Microsoft Outlook Fax Extension</strong> </p>
    <p>This component lets users easily generate and send new faxes to one or more contact
    addresses in a Microsoft Outlook Contacts folder. The optional Microsoft Outlook Fax
    Extension must be installed separately to be available to Microsoft Outlook clients. </p>
    <p><strong>Outlook Forms</strong> </p>
    <p>These forms let clients create and send faxes from an integrated fax form installed
    into Microsoft Outlook. RightFax Outlook forms also let clients receive new faxes into a
    form that includes a built-in fax viewer. Advanced forms can be installed on each client
    workstation separately. A simplified form does not require separate installation on each
    workstation. </p>
    <p><strong>Q. How do users send and receive faxes from Outlook?</strong> </p>
    <p>A. Sending a fax message is as easy as sending an email. When users send email
    messages, they tell the mail system where to send them by specifying an address. Most
    email addresses include a user ID, the user&#146;s post office, and other downstream
    information. RightFax follows the same principle, except that instead of sending a message
    directly to another user, it sends the message through the RightFax Gateway. </p>
    <p>The RightFax Gateway is tightly integrated with the mail system. Messages sent through
    the Gateway are transported to the RightFax fax server, which converts them into faxes and
    transmits them over the phone lines, intranet, or Internet. </p>
    <p>Routing received faxes into email accounts is the same process as sending faxes, only
    in reverse. When a fax arrives on a phone line, the fax board receives it, and RightFax
    determines to whom the fax belongs based on various predetermined routing options. Once
    the fax arrives into a RightFax account, RightFax checks to see if the fax should be
    routed to an email account, if the proper user email address is specified. The fax can be
    automatically deleted from the user&#146;s RightFax account or remain for future
    reference. </p>
    <p><strong>Q. How does administration of the RightFax solution for Exchange work?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>A. For Windows 2000, RightFax can be enabled to synchronize to Active Directory. This
    synchronization is one-directional only, meaning that RightFax properties are updated by
    Active Directory. The interval for the updates is customizable. The RightFax Active
    Directory Wizard walks administrators through the configuration. </p>
    <p>Administrators can also customize the synchronization by changing the mappings for
    these property associations directly from the Microsoft Management Console. The
    administrator can then manage all user accounts from Active Directory and modifications to
    any user in Active Directory automatically update the corresponding user in RightFax. </p>
    <p>RightFax gives fax functionality right from Outlook, while also providing
    administrators the flexibility to manage fax users from Microsoft Exchange or Active
    Directory. RightFax includes a snap-in for Microsoft Management Console for centralized
    administration of the gateway. </p>
    <p>Administrators can configure the following in the Microsoft Management Console: cover
    sheet options, user permissions, routing/notification options, automatic send/receive fax
    rules for printing, deleting and optical character recognition. </p>
