    Business Processes and Information</strong> </p>
    <p>Companies today are under increasing pressure to streamline business processes, improve
    interactions between customers and suppliers and reduce costs. Adapting to these new
    dynamics presents a significant challenge to the enterprise. </p>
    <p>Business depends on repeatable processes such as order processing, accounts payable
    processing and invoicing, customer support and supply chain management. These processes
    involve distribution of individualized documents, often in high volumes. Though most
    companies use sophisticated applications to house and manage corporate data, they still
    rely on antiquated manual processes to create and deliver the documents. </p>
    <p>Not only are these manual processes error-prone, but they waste valuable time in
    meeting customer and partner needs. In addition, the annual costs of producing and
    delivering these documents can be staggering - due to the high costs of labor, paper,
    envelopes and postage. Corporations are demanding a single solution that can efficiently
    pull business-critical data from a variety of customer applications - then provide more
    efficient channels of document distribution. </p>
    <p>A growing number of companies have discovered that they can achieve huge efficiencies
    by automating the exchange of information between customers, suppliers, partners and
    employees. Captaris is leading the way in automating business communication processes. We
    connect people, work flow processes and information - to speed communications and reduce
    the cost of doing business. Our RightFax Universal Information Exchange solutions enable
    companies to automate repetitive tasks and accelerate process cycle times. </p>
    <p><strong>With RightFax Information Exchange, your company will be able to:</strong> <ul>
      <li>Significantly speed interactions with customers and partners </li>
      <li>Bring efficiency to your workflow processes </li>
      <li>Improve service quality and information accuracy </li>
      <li>Eliminate manual processes that include printing, mailing, and faxing of documents </li>

    <p>in information processing time of up to 50% and operating cost savings in the range of
    $250,000 per year are typical - as are major gains in service quality and information
    accuracy. Truly breathtaking improvements are not unheard of. A senior executive of a
    large manufacturing company said that, using RightFax, &quot;. . . the time required to
    get an order entered and confirmed by our channel partners has gone from six days to six
    minutes.&quot; </p>
    <p>Improvements of this magnitude enable your internal and external teams to work together
    more efficiently - regardless of geographical location. The ultimate result? Increased
    customer and partner satisfaction, significant cost reductions - and improved long-term
    profitability. </p>
    <p><strong>INEFFICIENT MANUAL PROCESSES WASTE TIME AND MONEY</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Automate the flow of information from business applications to customers,
    trading partners and employees<br>
    </strong>Organizations, large and small, use many applications to run their business.
    These range from common desktop applications used by employees to legacy systems and
    corporate databases - such as Oracle, Siebel, SAP and others - that maintain and control
    corporate data. Other software packages bring further efficiencies to business including
    document management, forms and imaging applications. All of these applications output
    critical business information whether the need is for a single email to a customer, 10
    immediate loan approvals, or a weekly batch of 15,000 purchase orders. </p>
    <p>The good news is that these robust applications can automatically generate
    individualized business communications to meet virtually any business need. The bad news?
    These applications do not address document delivery and receipt. This is why most
    companies still rely on the postal service or general-purpose facsimile technologies to
    send and receive documents. Both of these methods involve labor-intensive, manual
    processes with multiple steps, multiple people and multiple information systems. Neither
    method adequately addresses the speed, volume, efficiency or reliability required for
    sending and receiving business-critical documents produced by enterprise applications. </p>
    <p><strong>Speed Communications and Reduce the Cost of Doing Business<br>
    </strong>Captaris brings document delivery into the 21st century. Our RightFax Universal
    Information Exchange solutions receive data from existing systems . . . transform the data
    into business documents . . . then exchange these documents electronically with customers
    and business partners. RightFax ensures that business processes are carried out
    automatically, eliminating human intervention except when a person&#146;s judgement or
    authorization is required. And, RightFax can deliver the information in whatever format
    your recipient wishes to receive it - fax, email or over the Internet. We even interface
    with Web-enabled mobile devices and remote printers. </p>
    <p>As a result, delivery time drops, because time-wasting manual processes and physical
    delivery of documents have been replaced with automated electronic processes. Delivery
    reliability and document quality go up, because errors such as lost documents or incorrect
    information are virtually eliminated. And costs are reduced by up to 90%, because the high
    costs of labor, postage and envelopes are eliminated. </p>
    <p><strong>CASE STUDY&nbsp;- NATIONAL AUSTRALIA GROUP</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Results Summary</strong> <ul>
      <li>Improved speed of communications with customers </li>
      <li>Reduced errors due to lost or incomplete information </li>
      <li>Reduced labor costs significantly </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many enterprises run multiple applications - but these applications are not able to
    work together to deliver critical information to business unit managers or trading
    partners. For instance, a company may have deployed a financial system, a CRM application,
    and a content management system. However, these systems are not integrated to enable the
    finance manager to retrieve outstanding invoices or order confirmations, deliver them
    automatically from the application to the customers, and track which customers received
    them. Nor is it possible to easily update the CRM application and the finance system with
    new contact information - if the existing data is incorrect. </p>
    <p>Captaris helps its customers overcome these kinds of problems and improve their
    business processes. Take a look at how we helped National Australia Group (NAG) integrate
    existing applications to automate their payment notification process. </p>
    <p>The National Australia Bank is among the world&#146;s 50th largest banks. Its parent,
    National Australia Group is an international financial services group providing
    comprehensive financial services across four continents and 15 countries. For many years,
    NAG depended on the manual faxing of mission-critical documents in its telephone banking
    and purchase order processes. As the number of customers grew, the process of using fax
    machines to manually send and receive documents became a bottleneck - causing delays and
    mistakes in getting important financial information to and from customers. </p>
    <p>National Australia Group began looking for a way to totally automate these slow, costly
    and error-prone processes. After an extensive evaluation, NAG decided to install Captaris
    RightFax with help from Kommunicate, a Captaris United Kingdom solution provider. The
    RightFax software automatically captures data from NAG&#146;s back office applications,
    places it into document templates, then sends the documents via fax to customers. Today,
    RightFax is National Australia Group&#146;s preferred fax solution for improving business
    communication processes. </p>
    <p>&quot;By eliminating manual faxing of payment confirmations, we achieved three
    immediate benefits,&quot; said Alan Wilson, Project Manager, National Australia Group.
    &quot;We were able to reduce head count and cut costs, improve the speed and accuracy of
    delivery and, since confirmations are set within minutes of receiving payment, the number
    of customers telephoning to request confirmation decreased dramatically.&quot; </p>
    <p><strong>CAPTARIS:&nbsp; THE LEADER IN AUTOMATING BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS</strong> </p>
    <p>The Captaris RightFax suite of products provides the most comprehensive information
    exchange solutions available to the enterprise. RightFax integrates easily with desktop
    and back office applications bringing automatic and instantaneous document delivery and
    receipt capabilities to these mission-critical business systems. </p>
    <p><strong>Tight Integration with Existing Applications<br>
    </strong>In order to ensure easy incorporation into business systems, a document
    automation solution must integrate tightly with existing applications. Because Captaris
    has more integrations than any of its competitors, RightFax can legitimately be described
    as a &quot;universal&quot; solution. It captures data from any existing system, regardless
    of format (email, XML, Java, text, print stream or data stream) or application (Host,
    Legacy, ERP or CRM). Captaris RightFax is a certified solution for leading software
    applications such as Microsoft, Lotus, SAP, Oracle, FileNet, Siebel and others. In fact,
    many of these technology leaders have made RightFax Universal Information Exchange their
    #1 recommendation to customers who wish to automate their business communications. </p>
    <p><strong>Leading-edge Technologies<br>
    </strong>RightFax takes advantage of Internet standards like Java, XML and the Component
    Object Model (COM) programming interface - to provide powerful tools for customizing
    solutions specific to your organization&#146;s needs. The RightFax XML Interface, the
    RightFax Java API, and the RightFax COM module offer the ultimate flexibility in
    implementing business automation solutions. </p>
    <p><strong>Integration with Email and EDI Systems<br>
    </strong>To facilitate interactions with a variety of trading partners, an information
    exchange solution should be flexible enough to support document delivery and receipt in a
    variety of forms. RightFax Information Exchange converts documents created in host
    applications into email documents that can be delivered over the Internet. It also has the
    capability to capture EDI data and send it as standard fax output. </p>
    <p><strong>Scalability and Performance Maximization<br>
    </strong>For most companies, the volume of documents will continue to grow for years to
    come. Captaris information exchange solutions are open and scalable, giving your company
    the ability to support growth efficiently and economically. Our solutions also include
    Intelligent Least Cost Routing and load-balancing capabilities, to help decrease costs and
    maximize performance - by preventing bottlenecks and delays in processing high volumes. </p>
    <p><strong>Secure and Reliable Document Delivery<br>
    </strong>In the wake of wellpublicized breaches of confidentiality, security is a major
    focus of corporations today. The RightFax SecureDocs module allows you to exchange
    electronic documents with customers and partners via certified delivery. Instead of being
    sent directly to the recipient, documents are sent to your organization&#146;s SecureDocs
    certified delivery Web site. The recipient receives an email message indicating that a
    certified document is available - and providing a link to the SecureDocs site.
    Confidential information remains secure, because your data never leaves your servers. </p>
    <p><strong>Comprehensive Tracking and Management<br>
    </strong>Due to the critical, time-sensitive nature of documents, it is essential for any
    information exchange solution to provide a comprehensive notification system to alert
    users of delivery status. Captaris provides advanced notification options, including email
    and host notification. </p>
    <p><strong>Document-Based, Robust Notification Capabilities<br>
    </strong>To ensure thatusers know with certainty that each document has been successfully
    delivered, RightFax has powerful and flexible notification capabilities. FCL commands are
    used to easily configure and deploy a vast range of notification messages that let you
    know the status of every message sent. Popular interfaces like MS Exchange, Lotus, SMTP,
    HLLAPI and ODBC can all be notified instantly upon a successful or failed fax
    transmission. </p>
    <p><strong>Ease of Use and Management<br>
    </strong>Faced with increasing requests to support corporate information needs, IT
    managers and system administrators seek proven technology solutions, which - once
    implemented - are easy to use and manage. RightFax has demonstrated its performance and
    reliability in thousands of enterprise installations. RightFax also features a rich set of
    system management tools, accessible through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) -
    which lets administrators manage RightFax servers easily from a single centralized
    location. </p>
    <p><strong>Four Phases of the RightFax Workflow Process</strong> </p>
    <p>RightFax utilizes a Four Phase Workflow Process that captures any form of information,
    renders it into an electronic image, distributes the information via fax, email, or over
    the Internet, and creates customized reporting, including host notifications. </p>
    <p><strong>PHASE 1: Data Recognition<br>
    </strong>RightFax accepts multiple forms of input: </p>

    <p><strong>RightFax Enterprise Integration</strong><br>
    RightFax Enterprise Integration provides corporations with a full-scale solution to
    automate business workflow processes. Security and encryption technology ensures that
    documents are delivered to just the intended recipients. This solution integrates with
    desktop, email, ERP, CRM, imaging and other back office applications simultaneously
    allowing for rapid and accurate exchange of documents throughout the organization, with
    customers and trading partners. </p>
    <p><strong>RightFax Business Integration</strong><br>
    RightFax Business Integration is the entry-level solution for organizations with low
    volume transactions that want to automate repetitive manual processes. Business
    Integration enables electronic delivery of critical business documents originating from
    mainframe, midrange, host or ERP systems. RightFax automates manual processes, speeding
    communications with trading partners and customers and reduces document delivery costs up
    to 90% </p>
    <p><strong>RightFax Enterprise Suite</strong><br>
    RightFax Enterprise Suite offers organizations all the benefits of the RightFax Enterprise
    Server with many additional functionality including integrations to Microsoft® Exchange
    and Lotus Notes ® , the PDF module which allows users to print PostScript and PDF
    documents directly to the RightFax print queue as well as send them as file attachments to
    e-mail messages when using one of the RightFax e-mail gateways. Included in the Enterprise
    Suite is the SNMP Alerting, which provides SNMP access to status data from the RightFax
    server and issues alerts on behalf of the server </p>
    <p><strong>RightFax Enterprise Server<br>
    </strong>RightFax Enterprise Server is designed for national or global organizations that
    want to combine the power of multiple RightFax servers on their network. The Enterprise
    Server includes all the benefits of the Business Server plus Intelligent Least-Cost
    Routing, load balancing, international character support, NT Security Authentication,
    Microsoft Word cover sheet support and can support cluster-aware installation. The web
    client, OCR, Docs-on-Demand and Teleconnect functionality are also included. </p>
    <p><strong>RightFax Business Server</strong><br>
    RightFax Business Server is ideal for company, department or workgroups throughout an
    organization. Employees can send and receive faxes from the desktop computer, eliminating
    the processes of manual faxing. Enabling faxing right at the desktop reduces document
    delivery costs by up to 90%. RightFax also preserves security and privacy because all
    documents are delivered to individual computers, not the department fax station. </p>
    <p>Additional add-on modules provide enhanced features and functionality for email
    integration, Internet delivery and inbound document receipt and management. </p>
    <p><strong>MANY INDUSTRIES CAN BENEFIT FROM AUTOMATING BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Manufacturing<br>
    </strong>Manufacturing in the 21st century demands that information flow freely throughout
    the extended enterprise. Functional departments such as R&amp;D, design, engineering,
    marketing, compliance, quality assurance and assembly need to share information
    seamlessly. These departments are also collaborating with suppliers and resellers.
    Captaris makes it easy for internal and external teams to share content as work flows
    through manufacturing processes. Captaris can automate key manufacturing processes across
    the enterprise, including: <ul>
      <li>Automation of bid management to speed the procurement process. </li>
      <li>Simultaneous distribution of manufacturing specs, which enables the home office to
        enforce a &quot;copy exactly&quot; standard at every plant. </li>
      <li>Management of change orders, standard operating procedures, bills of materials, and
        more. All of this information must be tracked, controlled, versioned, published,
        repurposed and archived. </li>
      <li>Acceleration of the entire manufacturing process from R&amp;D to shipping, enabling
        just-in-time manufacturing with substantially less investment in inventory. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Distribution<br>
    </strong>Distributors face ever-increasing demands to slash time and costs as inventory
    moves from manufacturers to customers. RightFax Information Exchange helps circumvent the
    costly, time-consuming manual faxing or emailing of bills of lading, shipping reports, and
    other documents that must be transferred in large volumes to customers or suppliers. </p>
    <p><strong>Financial Services and Banking<br>
    </strong>Why do 8 out of the top 10 U.S. banks, along with 900 other leading financial
    institutions, use RightFax Information Exchange for their mission-critical business
    processes? They have discovered they can trim operating costs and improve customer service
    by automating routine communications. Captaris delivers key financial services solutions,
    including: <ul>
      <li>Deliver product rate/term sheets throughout distribution channel(s) on desired frequency
        and with desired location specific information. </li>
      <li>Provide end customer with loan documents (approve/deny) with copy to broker/dealer via
        delivery method of choice (email, fax, mobile). </li>
      <li>Provide daily call list (with scripts) to broker/dealer for prospect calls and customer
        inquiry follow up. </li>
      <li>Provide customer with consolidated positions/balances on desired frequency (i.e. real
        time, daily, monthly, quarterly, etc.) with note to client service team </li>
      <li>Alert client relationship manager and appropriate team member of customer
        inquiry/contacts, particularly regarding service issues </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Healthcare<br>
    </strong>Unstructured data and fragmented communications are at the heart of Healthcare
    inefficiencies. The consequences impact the quality of patient care, productivity, and
    profitability. And as medical necessity becomes a top priority in resource
    decision-making, reimbursement, and revenue generation, the criticality of integrated
    technology solutions will become a priority in resource allocation. RightFax Information
    Exchange automates the access to information, which can lower operating costs for the
    customer and increase quality of care for patients, as well as assist healthcare operators
    with HIPAA compliancy. </td>
