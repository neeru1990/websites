    <p align="left"><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA" size="2"><b>Executive Summary</b></font><small><br>
    <br>
    Buyers need a firm grasp of fax phone line capacity issues, in part because one less than
    optimal way to sell fax servers is to keep the initial bid price low by specifying fax
    servers that are under-equipped with lines. That sales tactic can win bids, but in the end
    does a disservice to buyers who get less than expected performance at the budgeted price.
    Buyers may be left with the dilemma of either going over budget, taking out the fax server
    and starting over again, or settling for subpar performance for meeting their fax
    dissemination needs, which translates into subpar performance in meeting customer service
    needs. This report is intended to give buyers enough understanding of line-sizing factors
    so that they can make informed purchase decisions in order to protect themselves from
    unwelcome price/performance trade-off surprises.<br>
    <br>
    Although some rough industry averages exist as to how many fax server users can
    effectively share a line (for example, 7 to 25 fax users per line), optimal ratios of
    users to lines depends on and varies widely according to numerous site-specific factors.<br>
    <br>
    Site-specific factors include how many pages of fax traffic users generate, peak-hour
    traffic volumes, fax board efficiency, acceptable levels of queue delay, whether inbound
    as well as outbound fax traffic is supported, and how much new fax traffic will the
    existence of a fax server create?<br>
    <br>
    <i>Too few lines</i> can result in delayed communications and lost opportunities and lost
    sales due to inbound faxes that never reach an open line. <i>Too many lines</i> may cause
    businesses to incur some unnecessary expenditures, but having ample capacity ensures
    timely transmissions and provides room to grow as fax traffic volumes increase.<br>
    Another rule of thumb for estimating line requirements is to take a page from single-line
    4-page-per-minute business fax machines, which are typically shared by 10 to 25 users.<br>
    <br>
    The real task of determining fax server line capacity needs comes down not only to
    identifying or estimating current fax traffic levels, but also estimating what percentage
    of that traffic will move to the fax server. In addition, consideration must be given to: </small></p>
    <div align="center"><ul>
      <li><p align="left"><small>How much new traffic will emerge </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>What critical peak-hour volumes must be supported. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>How much business-hour fax traffic can be shifted to after-hours
        delivery through easy computer-based fax invoking of delayed-transmission commands. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>How long it actually takes, on average, to send faxes, which in
        large part depends on fax board capabilities and the type of installed machines to which
        you send and receive faxes. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>How much queuing delay is tolerable because, with outbound faxes,
        fax servers can store transmissions in long queues, eventually faxing out all jobs, but
        potentially causing delays up to many hours long relative to delivering most or all faxes.
        </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Whether special factors relating to inbound faxes should be
        considered, including the fact that adequate percentages of lines (for example, 25% - 50%)
        should be free to receive faxes at any given time (lest one's business lose orders and
        other opportunities because inbound fax calls are blocked). Also, where Direct Inward Dial
        (DID) lines are used to support automated routing of inbound faxes to individual
        recipients, capacity sizing must be done separately for inbound and outbound traffic
        because DID services only use receive-only lines. </small></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA" size="2"><b><p align="left">How Many Lines Does My Fax Server
    Need?</b></font><small><br>
    <br>
    One of the most difficult assessments fax server buyers must make is how many fax server
    phone lines to install. Ultimately, this becomes an issue that hinges on the specifics of
    each fax server installation. Although some rough industry averages exist &#150; broadly,
    7 to 25 fax users per line, or more narrowly, 12 to 20 users per line (according to
    Davidson Consulting) &#150; they may be either ill-suited or just too vague to be applied
    successfully to some specific fax server installations. Moreover, some dealers resort to
    winning business by offering lowball pricing &#150; with that pricing not reflecting a
    narrowing of their margins or commissions, but an unstated under-equipping of fax server
    ports that buyers often don't comprehend til the system is up and running.<br>
    <br>
    Rather than using anyone's rule of thumb &#150; after all, Davidson Consulting has come
    across sites where there are multiple phone lines for each user (and there should be
    because each user is initiating large broadcast fax jobs) as well as sites where more than
    50 users share a line and management professes that no performance penalty results
    (however, Davidson Consulting generally will not recommend sharing a line among more than
    25 users and believes that, where greater numbers of users successfully share a fax line,
    it usually means either that many counted as users don't actively computer fax, or that
    sites are located in countries where phone lines are so expensive and hard to get that
    users simply accept less than optimal performance as the norm).<br>
    <br>
    Given the potential variances, then, it follows that the number of lines needed for each
    fax server should be assessed according to factors specific to each business, department
    and/or workgroup that the fax server will support, including: </small></p>
    </div><div align="center"><ul>
      <li><p align="left"><small>How much existing fax traffic will the fax server have to
        support? </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>How much new fax traffic will the existence of a fax server
        create? </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>How much fax traffic must be handled during peak hours and/or the
        execution of major fax applications, like broadcasts? </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Can fax server features be used to manage peak-hour volumes? </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>What kind of fax boards will be used and what are the relative
        throughput speeds they support &#150; and, to complete this equation, (a) what throughput
        speeds are supported by the installed base of fax devices to which the fax server will
        transmit, and (b) what are the page densities of the faxes the fax server will process?
        Systems using intelligent fax boards with 14.4 Kbs transmission speed and MMR compression
        often can handle the same amount of fax traffic as Class 2 fax modems with about 33% fewer
        lines. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>How much queuing delay is tolerable for outbound faxes? </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Are faxes being received as well as transmitted? If so, how many
        lines or how much line time is required to effectively handle inbound fax volume? </small></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"><small>Although, in most cases, VARs, systems integrators or fax server
    vendors will analyze the factors at work relative to specific installations and then make
    recommendations, buyers are still advised to understand and scrutinize fax server sizing
    dynamics well enough to assess whether the number of ports recommended is based on the
    needs of the buyer's business or on some sellers' propensity to try to win sales via
    pricing that is artificially low due to under specifying initial ports.<br>
    <br>
    Also, although line capacity can be managed and optimized after the initial implementation
    of a fax server (and businesses must understand that situations arise where
    well-intentioned sizing estimates miss the mark and post-installation adjustments must be
    made), a business may pay a price for installing too many or too few fax server phone
    lines. If too few lines are installed, typical results include: </small></p>
    </div><div align="center"><ul>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Outbound message delivery is delayed by many minutes or hours,
        potentially disrupting, delaying or even occasionally undermining certain business
        endeavors. For instance, although a delivery delay of 45 minutes for an accounting report
        being faxed to a regional office usually is insignificant, if the same delay occurs when
        faxing back an approval for a retail credit request or loan application, the delay itself
        can cause a loss of business. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Inbound faxes frequently may be blocked if all lines are often
        busy &#150; which may usually cause relatively trivial delays, but in worst-case
        scenarios, for example, can completely block the reception of sales orders, with the
        result that senders of those sales orders eventually fax them to competitors instead of
        the company with the overloaded fax server. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>If a fax server is generally heavily loaded, it may become
        problematic to execute business-hour fax broadcasts, creating a lost opportunity in which
        potential time and money savings go by the wayside. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>The ability to fax something immediately, such as when called
        with an urgent information request, may become unpredictable at best, and impossible at
        worst. A business can project a negative image to customers by being unable to fax
        information quickly. For example, the airline that can only promise that faxes containing
        ticket-less flight information will arrive within 24 hours may lose business with frequent
        flyers that often buy same-day and next-day tickets (or may just create a subtle level of
        mistrust in such frequent flyers that, down the road, may feed into their being quicker to
        decide to switch their allegiance to another airline). </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>As it becomes clear that additional lines are needed, businesses
        must install new lines, which means additional installation costs and often significantly
        impacts normal business operations during the time the fax server is being upgraded. </small></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"><small>If too many lines are installed, typical results include: </small></p>
    </div><div align="center"><ul>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Extra and at least temporarily unnecessary expense for fax card
        ports &#150; if only for any that are greatly underutilized. Generally, though, computer
        fax-enabling workers allows them to fax more documents (for example, instead of mail
        documents or making time-consuming voice calls &#150; or just not communicating the
        information at all), and having &quot;too much&quot; capacity initially often translates
        into having enough capacity to grow into as traffic volume rises over time. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Similarly, in cases where telephone lines are installed directly
        to a fax server (as opposed to through a PBX relative to shared lines) &#150; and no one
        figures out to cancel the service for currently unnecessary and extra lines &#150;
        unnecessarily high and ongoing payments will be disbursed to one's phone company. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>In terms of the effect on fax server performance &#150; well,
        performance should be terrific, with both outbound and inbound fax calls handled in
        extremely timely fashion. </small></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"><small>Moreover, it is important to understand that initially having extra
    capacity can make sense because it supports the virtually inevitable growth in fax traffic
    that occurs with computer-based fax implementations. In fact, there is clearly a market
    trend whereby businesses, upon calculating that their traffic volumes can be handled
    satisfactorily by four ports, are instead installing 8-port cards precisely to give
    themselves room to grow (and, at least in advanced countries, you can add phone service on
    a line-by-line basis as extra lines are required). Finally, relative to having extra
    capacity to grow into, buyers should remember not only that installing up to twice actual
    current capacity levels can have value, but that in most situations, any fax server should
    be scalable to support up to ten times its original actual line requirements. In other
    words, if it absolutely needs 4 lines (but you install 8 for room to grow in the
    near-term), the fax server should also support future expansion, whether on one or
    multiple servers, to support up a minimum of 40 lines (for example, ten times the original
    4-line volume level).<br>
    <br>
    <a name="thumb" target="_blank"></a></small><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA" size="2"><b>Rules
    of Thumb Can Help, But Don't Become &quot;All Thumbs&quot;</b></font><small><br>
    <br>
    A few rules of thumb for estimating fax server capacity needs:<br>
    <br>
    <b>Taking a Cue From Fax Machines:</b><br>
    <br>
    One-line <i>business</i> fax machines (for example, laser fax machines that print at four
    pages per minute or faster) are typically shared by 10 to 25 users, according to Davidson
    Consulting. Producing similar information over the 5 years they have been conducted,
    annual Pitney Bowes/Gallup polls of corporate fax usage patterns have shown results
    indicating corporate fax machine sharing by average numbers of users ranging from a low of
    14 users per line one year to a high of 21 users per line another year (note than an
    average of 14 users per fax machine suggests a range of perhaps 8 to 20 users sharing most
    corporate fax machines). Such ranges, whether 8 to 20 users or 10 to 25 or even 12 to 30,
    provide an indication of how many users comfortably share a single fax machine phone line.<br>
    <br>
    However, because fax servers automate the process of sending faxes (for example, make it
    easier to broadcast faxes to multiple recipients), fax servers tend to generate higher
    volumes of outbound faxes per user than fax machines (and such increases in outbound
    traffic tend to create a reciprocity that in turn increases inbound fax server traffic
    too). Assuming a 25% increase in fax traffic per user due to computer-based fax
    automation, the users-per-fax-line ranges listed above for fax machines would, for fax
    servers, become: 6 to 15 users or 8 to 18 or 9 to 23, respectively.<br>
    <br>
    <b>The Time to Fax a Page:</b><br>
    <br>
    It can take a shorter or longer time to send a fax or even an identical fax page,
    depending on (a) the capabilities of both the sending and receiving fax devices in a fax
    phone call, and (b) on the make-up of fax pages (the more text and other print on a fax
    page, the longer that page takes to transmit). However, a long-standing and widely-used
    rough estimate of the time it takes to fax a single page is one minute (including call
    setup time, between-page retraining, actual page transmission time, and allowances for
    redialing time too). Where departments within large corporations have leading-edge 14.4
    Kbs machines and tend to fax often to corporate recipients, a more accurate rule-of-thumb
    is 30 seconds per page.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Don't Rely Solely on Rules of Thumb!</b><br>
    <br>
    Don't automatically assume that rules of thumb fit your specific needs. There are
    corporate workgroups comprised of frequent fax broadcasters where anything less than
    multiple lines for each single user would create serious under capacity situations!
    Moreover, the very term &quot;user&quot; is fraught with ambiguity: a business may have
    100 users on a LAN, but only 20 or 50 or 80 that fax frequently at all and, of those, only
    10 or 25 or 40 may use computer fax frequently. If you know that only 20 users on the LAN
    actually fax, then the initial number of fax server users should be considered 20, not
    100.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, relative to the actual duration of different types of fax calls, note that
    intra-company fax calls involving state-of-the-art fax transmission and compression
    technology (and simple text documents) can bring the average time to fax a page down to
    under 15 seconds, making the one-minute average a recipe for overcooking one's fax server
    capabilities.<br>
    <br>
    </small><font size="2"><b>Determining Fax Server Line Capacity Needs</b></font><small> <b>Estimating
    How Much Existing and New Fax Traffic a Fax Server Must Support</b><br>
    <br>
    A fax server must have capacity to support:<br>
    <i><b>Existing fax traffic</b></i> that will migrate to the fax server, as in that share
    of faxing that a business does (before it installs the fax server), via PC fax systems and
    fax machines, that subsequently will be handled through the fax server. Calculating
    overall existing fax traffic sometimes can be done (more often it can't) by analyzing
    telephone system call-detail records. Lacking that resource, fax traffic levels can be
    roughly estimated by printing periodic reports at fax machines and then extrapolating load
    levels. Assessing how much existing fax traffic will migrate to a fax server can be tricky
    because it depends on (a) how much of the traffic originates as computer files and how
    much originates as paper, and (b) the computer skills and resources of individual users,
    with users with strong computer skills more likely to computer-fax more often and those
    with limited computer skills more likely to continue extensively using fax machines.<br>
    <br>
    <i><b>New fax traffic,</b></i> as in fax traffic involving calls that were not made prior
    to the installation of a fax server. New fax traffic typically arises upon installing fax
    servers because: </small></p>
    </div><div align="center"><ul>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Many users find that computer-based fax makes it easier and
        quicker to send 'everyday' faxes, so they send more faxes </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Fax broadcast traffic often picks up as end users discover that
        initiating ad hoc fax broadcasts via fax servers is as simple as clicking on multiple
        recipients in a computer-based fax phone book &#150; and this can lead, for example, to
        doing a single fax broadcast to 6 recipients rather than sequentially making 6 phone calls
        </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Businesses often use fax servers to fax-enable one or more
        relatively high-volume strategic applications (for example, auto faxing purchase orders,
        financial statements, inventory lists and other regularly generated paper documents that
        previously had been distributed as physical mail). This can add hundreds or thousands of
        fax pages to overall daily volumes </small></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"><small>Amounts of new fax traffic obviously can only be
    &quot;guess-timated,&quot; although, relative to automating specific applications, it may
    at least be possible to extrapolate from existing volumes of document pages already
    generated for the application, for example, relative to its traditional delivery by

    <br>
    The number of lines a fax server should support may be substantially impacted by strategic
    needs to meet peak-hour traffic delivery requirements. For example, a financial
    institution may receive a particular set of information every morning at 10 am &#150; that
    it must then turn around and transmit, in as timely and equitably a fashion as possible,
    to 100 customers. Although the company's fax server might perform well at all other hours
    of the day with just four lines, that single 10 am broadcast could create both a need and
    cost-justification for a server with 16 lines (with 12 lines used to complete the
    broadcast in just 20 to 30 minutes, while the other 4 lines continue to support normal
    business-hour fax volume). Meanwhile, if the company tries to handle that same broadcast
    with just the four lines that would otherwise suffice (assuming that the broadcast would
    take over two of the four lines), the results would include: </small></p>
    </div><div align="center"><ul>
      <li><p align="left"><small>The broadcast would then last two to three hours, losing its
        timeliness. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>During those two to three hours, other fax traffic would have
        access to only two lines instead of four. That could mean (a) that 50% of such ad hoc
        faxing could get backlogged over that two to three hour period, with those backlogs
        possibly not working themselves back to levels of tolerable delay until several hours
        after the two to three hour broadcast finally ends, and/or (b) the fax server could become
        so highly utilized with outbound traffic that it becomes nearly impossible to receive
        inbound traffic. </small></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"><small>Conversely, however, the capabilities of fax servers to let users
    easily delay fax jobs can be used, when appropriate, to reduce peak-hour traffic.
    Non-critical faxes and fax broadcasts can be scheduled for after-hours transmission in
    order to even out hourly traffic loads and enable the same amount of fax traffic to be
    supported by fewer overall telephone lines.<br>
    <br>
    </small><font size="2"><b>The Time It Takes to Process and Transmit a Fax</b></font><small><br>
    <br>
    How quickly fax phone calls are actually completed can vary tremendously depending on:<br>
    The page transmission speeds (for example, 9.6 or 14.4 Kbs) supported by both fax devices
    involved in a fax phone call. If both fax systems transmit at 14.4 Kbs, pages will be
    faxed at that speed. If a fax server is equipped with 14.4 Kbs fax modems, it will fax at
    14.4 Kbs with other 14.4 Kbs fax devices (as of year-end 1996, about 30% of corporate fax
    traffic in the US was transmitting at 14.4 Kbs) or drop down to 9.6 Kbs when faxing to
    receive-end devices that only support that slower speed. If equipped with only 9.6 Kbs fax
    modems, fax servers can transmit no faster than 9.6 Kbs, regardless of whether receive-end
    fax machines can transmit at 14.4 Kbs or not.<br>
    <br>
    Although not nearly as widely known about or understood as transmission speed, fax
    compression methods can lengthen or reduce fax phone call times more dramatically than
    transmission speed, more often. That is, compression is used to &quot;squeeze down&quot;
    the amount of data to be faxed prior to transmission; the less data that needs to be
    faxed, the more quickly the fax phone call can be completed. Virtually all fax machines
    and computer-based fax systems used today are Group 3 (G/3) devices, which all use the
    mandatory standard G/3 compression method, Modified Huffman (MH) &#150; which is less
    efficient than two other optional G/3 compression methods, Modified Read (MR) and Modified
    Modified Read (MMR). Table 1 below shows fax page transmission times depending on
    combinations of transmission speed plus the three different compression methods. Notably,
    the 9.6/MR combination can send a page in just 15 seconds, while the 14.4/MH combination
    results in a sending time that is 33% longer at 20 seconds per page, which indicates the
    relative power of MR versus 14.4 Kbs transmission speed on overall fax phone call
    duration.<br>

    <p><small>Meanwhile, intelligent fax boards may offer additional throughput advantages
    over 'Class' modems relative to (a) more efficient bit-stuffing (see the Davidson
    Consulting publication, Hidden Fax Board Costs &amp; Secrets to Savings), and (b) their
    on-board microprocessors tend to handle image-conversion and other associated overhead
    processing tasks more efficiently (for example, on-the-fly) than Class 2 modems &#150;
    with the less efficient Class modem/host-related processing potentially causing delays in
    between fax phone calls and thereby taking yet more time overall to complete series of fax
    jobs.<br>
    <br>
    </small><font size="2"><b>How Much Queuing Delay Is Tolerable?</b></font><small><br>
    <br>
    With outbound faxes, fax servers whose phone lines are already busy handling fax calls can
    manage additional fax job submissions by storing them in memory (for example, on a hard
    drive), where they are &quot;queued&quot; and then, as phone lines become free,
    sequentially relayed to the fax server's phone lines for transmission. Due to this kind of
    capability, it is possible, for example, to have a 2-line fax server support 100 active
    users. If we assume that each active user submits two 2-minute fax jobs per hour during
    every hour of an eight-hour day, here's what happens: </small></p>
    </div><div align="left"><ul>
      <li><small>At the end of the first hour, assuming 120 minutes of faxes have been processed
        (60 minutes times 2 lines), 80 minutes of the total of 200 minutes of fax jobs submitted
        will still be queued up. A fax job initiated right at the end of the first hour, then,
        won't actually be transmitted until after 40 minutes has passed, because the fax server
        will have to work through the 80 minutes of queued jobs first, which it will do in 40
        minutes due to its two phone lines. </small></li>
      <li><small>Each successive hour throughout the day, the length of queue delays will double.
        At the end of two hours, the delay will be 80 minutes; after three hours, a two-hour delay
        will exist. At the end of eight hours, a 5-hour-and-20-minute delay will exist. And, about
        5 hours and 20 minutes after closing time, the last of the queued faxes would finally be
        delivered. </small></li>
    </ul>
    <p><small>There are situations where it is acceptable for faxes to be delivered after
    considerable delays (for example, where next-day delivery suffices). If the fax server is
    installed in a region, such as in an underdeveloped country, where phone lines are very
    expensive to install or it may require months or even years to get additional phone lines
    installed, then it may be understandable for a fax server to be equipped with so few phone
    lines relative to its traffic volume. But Davidson Consulting, while allowing that such
    situations can be understandable, does not ever recommend under-powering fax servers in
    this manner. Here's why: </small></p>
    </div><div align="left"><ul>
      <li><small>Faxes often involve documents that drive business transactions; delaying faxes
        risks losing business represented by those transactional documents. </small></li>
      <li><small>Delayed fax deliveries can create negative impressions in the minds of trading
        partners. </small></li>
      <li><small>Delayed faxes can interrupt the work processes of a company's own workforce,
        lowering worker productivity by repeatedly causing workflow to be disjointed and high
        numbers of tasks to be pending for longer than necessary periods of time. </small></li>
    </ul>
    <font size="2"><b><p>Special Considerations Relative to Receiving Faxes</b></font><small><br>
    <br>
    Some fax servers are used predominately or totally to send outbound faxes; assessing the
    number of lines they need simply involves figuring out how many lines are necessary to
    handle peak-hour traffic and to maintain queue delays within tolerable limits. Having
    outbound-only fax server phone lines highly utilized most of the time is a goal, not a
    problem.<br>
    <br>
    When fax servers also receive faxes, the situation changes. Fax lines cannot be highly
    utilized and be ready to receive faxes. It's one or the other: </small></p>
    </div><div align="left"><ul>
      <li><small>If a fax line is busy 75% of the time, most inbound fax calls will initially
        receive busy signals and unacceptably high numbers of calls &#150; <i><b>more than
        one-third</b></i> &#150; will not be received, even if they automatically redial three
        times. </small></li>
      <li><small>In order for fax server phone lines to be ready to receive faxes, they cannot be
        busy almost all the time or even most of the time. A single fax server line used for
        reception should be free to receive calls more than half the time during all fax-reception
        time periods. </small></li>
    </ul>
    <p><small>With multi-line fax servers, important considerations include: </small></p>
    </div><ul align="left">
      <li><p align="left"><small>That adequate percentages of lines (for example, 25% to 50%) be
        free to receive faxes at any given time. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>In many cases, to prevent outbound fax broadcasts and the like
        from monopolizing all of a fax server's phone lines, it can make sense to dedicate some
        lines solely to receiving faxes. For one, this allows the company to fine-tune queue
        delays on outbound faxes without diminishing the ability to receive faxes efficiently. On
        the other hand, the overall efficiency with which a fax server can expedite the sum total
        of all fax calls passing through it is greater when most or all lines can be used for both
        sending and receiving. </small></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"><small>It is strongly recommended that all but the very lowest-volume fax
    servers, when used to receive as well as send faxes, be equipped with at least two lines
    so faxes can be received even while others are being transmitted outbound.<br>
    <br>
    Direct Inward Dialing (DID), which is the most widely used form of automated inbound
    routing (whereby faxes received at a fax server are automatically routed to LAN-based
    inboxes of individual recipients), creates an additional consideration because DID lines
    are receive-only.<br>
    <br>
    </small><font size="2"><b>Conclusions</b></font><small> </small></p>
    <ul align="left">
      <li><p align="left"><small>A general rule of thumb is 7 to 25 fax users per line (needs may
        vary; see <a
        href="http://64.4.22.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&amp;lah=cc9b32426d32f37863bfb022805b7f3c&amp;lat=998199488&amp;hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2ebrooktrout%2ecom%2fwhitepapers%2fhtml_pages%2fhow_buy%2ehtml%23thumb"
        target="_blank"><font color="#006699">Rules of Thumb....</font></a> for details). </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Only analysis of site-specific factors can really begin to zero
        in on the number of lines needed &#150; and even those efforts can miss the mark a bit due
        to poor information up front (for example, extrapolating volume from fax machine log
        printouts isn't exactly a science) and some not uncommon post-installation surprises,
        usually involving extra usage generated spontaneously by the very introduction of the fax
        server resource. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Surprises can always happen (without it being anyone's fault, but
        merely a potentially unpredictable situation), so buyers need to understand that
        post-installation adjustments may have to be made. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>Having &quot;too many&quot; lines may or may not be a problem,
        but having too few lines almost always has negative consequences. </small></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><small>In the end, it is critical that buyers have a firm grasp of fax
        phone line issues, in part because one less than optimal way to sell fax servers is to
        keep the initial bid price low by specifying fax servers that are under-equipped with
        lines. That sales tactic can win bids, but then do a disservice to buyers who get less
        than expected performance at the budgeted price and are left with the dilemma of either
        going over budget, taking out the fax server and starting over again, or settling for
        subpar performance for meeting their fax dissemination needs, which translates into subpar
        performance in meeting customer service needs. </small></p>
