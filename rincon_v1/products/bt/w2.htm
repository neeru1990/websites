    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Executive Summary</b><br>
    <br>
    A myth exists that all fax boards and fax modems are essentially the same. If they all
    send at 14.4 Kbs speed, then all fax phone bills are the same and what else could matter?
    But fax technology can be surprising: for example, even sending at 14.4 Kbs, Class 1 and 2
    fax modems typically triple page transmission time compared to intelligent fax board
    throughput!<br>
    <br>
    Three distinct types of fax cards exist: Class 1 fax modems, Class 2 fax modems, and
    intelligent fax boards, and each provides substantially different levels of performance.
    In the mid-volume scenario presented in this white paper, intelligent fax boards are shown
    to reduce life-of-system fax phone bills by about $3,700 over Class 2 boards and by about
    $6,500 over Class 1 boards.<br>
    <br>
    The reasons why intelligent fax boards provide superior performance may be obscure &#150;
    including Modified Modified Read compression, signal-to-noise ratios, bit-stuffing,
    critical timing issues and call progress capabilities &#150; but they are no less real to
    the bottom line for being esoteric. This paper explains how fax boards differ, how those
    differences play out according to fax phone call elements and installed base capabilities,
    and why intelligent fax boards are a superior choice for virtually all but the very
    lowest-volume computer fax applications.<br>
    <br>
    This paper also provides a checklist of items to consider when purchasing intelligent fax
    boards.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="why"></a><b>Why to Buy Intelligent Fax Boards</b><br>
    <br>
    In the glossy pages of the popular computer trade press, the &quot;fax modem&quot; has
    been widely regarded as a commodity item, triggering the widely held belief that all fax
    modems are the same. In fact, however, vast disparities exist between the performance
    provided by low-cost fax/data modems (for example, Class 1 and 2 devices) and intelligent
    fax boards (fax cards with on-board microprocessors). Schooled largely by the trade press,
    when equipping their LAN fax servers, fax-on-demand systems and fax broadcasting engines
    with fax cards, businesses all too often choose low-cost fax modems, a choice that
    typically saddles them with one or more of the following problems: </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Dollar Drain:</b> Just about every fax phone call made
        with low-cost fax modems costs about twice as much as necessary in usage charges paid to
        one's telephone company (and it can literally be ten times as much!). This is a critical
        issue because over the life of a fax system, the &quot;pennies&quot; paid for thousands of
        fax calls tend to add up to far more than the original purchase price.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Hassle:</b> Headaches arise from unnecessarily high
        percentages of fax phone calls never being completed by low-cost fax modems, particularly
        with Class 1 devices.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Disinterest:</b> A fall-off occurs in computer fax system
        usage by workers due to the unreliability of the low-cost fax modems on which the system
        is based.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Quick System Max-Out:</b> Low-cost modems fail to support
        adequate system scalability because they require general-purpose PCs to struggle to muster
        enough power, quickly enough, to manage the multi-channel faxing that intelligent fax
        boards support with ease. When businesses commit to systems using fax cards that don't
        scale up well, one result can be the needless expense of an extra PC for every couple of
        ports (instead, for example, of one PC supporting 24 or 48 ports).<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Languishing Labor:</b> When low-cost modems are installed
        on personal PCs, a hidden toll is extracted from users who are forced to sit idly while
        under-powered fax modems demand full PC microprocessor attention. <br>
        </font><font size="1" face="Arial"><a href="#top">Back to the topics </a></font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="intelligence"></a><b>Intelligence Report:
    Differentiating Fax Cards</b><br>
    <br>
    The three types of fax cards are Class 1 modems, Class 2 modems, and intelligent fax
    boards: </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Class 1</b> fax modems (EIA 578) comprise the lowest-cost
        category for a very simple reason: they rely totally on the power of PC microprocessors
        for tasks critical to sending faxes, including the conversion of PC files to fax format,
        support for bit-stuffing (bit-stuffing is explained below), and management of the fax
        phone call itself, including all signaling to set up and maintain a fax call. They support
        fast transmission speed (14.4 Kbs), but only the slowest form of standard fax compression.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Class 2</b> fax modems, like their Class 1 cousins, rely
        on the power of PC microprocessors to convert PC files to fax format, but handle all
        signaling to set up and maintain fax calls via on-board circuitry. They may handle bit
        stuffing on-board or via the PC microprocessor, but support only low level fax
        compression. Note that there are both Class 2 and 2.0 fax modems: (1) Class 2 modems are
        based on a de facto standard [a proposed standard that was voted down &#150; but
        manufacturers produced modems Class 2 modems anyway, resulting in many &quot;flavors&quot;
        of Class 2 modems]; millions of Class 2 modems are installed; while some bit-stuff
        on-the-fly, many do not; (2) Class 2.0 fax modems, which comply with the official EIA 592
        standard, handle bit-stuffing on-the-fly; but Davidson Consulting was aware of only three
        Class 2.0-compatible devices on the market a full two years after the 2.0 standard was
        approved.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Intelligent Fax Boards</b> differentiate themselves via
        on-board microprocessors which, in addition to sending faxes at 14.4 Kbs speed, also can
        support advanced fax compression methods, convert documents to fax format and bit-stuff
        on-the-fly on the board (not on the PC), and can manage fax phone calls via on-board
        processing power.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Intelligent fax boards carry the highest price tags, which
    is why buyers naturally flock to the lower-cost &quot;class&quot; modems. But they save
    far, far more than the differential in cost by more reliably completing calls (see <a
    href="#table1"><b>Table 1</b></a>), sending faxes in less time to reduce fax phone bills
    (see <a href="#table2"><b>Table 2</b></a>), by minimizing maintenance issues, by providing
    strong enough performance that people actually use the computer fax systems based on them,
    and by cost-effectively exploiting server resources.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Are You Bit-Stuffing Your Fax Phone Bill?</b><br>
    <br>
    Bit stuffing is required because, with many older non-memory fax machines, the code sent
    to describe a fax scan line transmits than the time it takes the printhead to move across
    the page. The solution is to stuff extra bits into the code to keep the mechanical parts
    synchronized. The receive-end fax machine invokes the need for bit-stuffing and, if the
    sending device cannot bit stuff, the fax call aborts. The best way to bit-stuff is
    dynamically, on-the-fly, via an on-board microprocessor. This ways, fax phone call time is
    extended for bit stuffing only when called for and only to the extent necessary. The
    alternative is to pre-stuff every file to be computer faxed, but this means that every fax
    phone call lasts longer and that more bits than necessary must be stuffed. Assuming that
    only 10% to 25% of the worldwide fax installed base actually requires bit stuffing, then
    pre-storing unnecessarily extends 75% to 90% of calls, typically by about 40%, give or
    take. <br>

    <a name="anatomy"></a><b>Anatomy of a Fax Phone Call</b><br>
    <br>
    A great deal of the difference in modem types can be illustrated by examining the elements
    of a fax phone call: </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Document Conversion:</b> computer files must be converted
        from original formats to the G/3 fax format (for example, a TIFF file). Document
        conversion is about 10 to 20 times more processing-intensive than managing the actual fax
        phone call. <i><b>Both Class 1 and 2 fax modems place the document conversion burden --
        which is the primary bottleneck area in a computer fax system -- on the PC, not on
        themselves.</b></i> This either substantially reduces the volume of traffic that any fax
        server can support or interferes with the ability of individual users to use their
        fax-enabled PCs while documents are being converted.<br>
        <br>
        Intelligent fax boards can handle document conversion on-board on-the-fly, freeing PC
        resources so a fax server can support greater volume or so end users need not sit idly at
        their PCs during fax phone call preparation time. They may also support on-the-fly
        enhancements to images, such as automatically superimposing business-form designs onto raw
        data (called business-form overlay) and scaling document sizes to fit the need of
        receive-end fax machines (for example, from the letter size used in the US to the B4 paper
        size used in Japan).<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Call Progress (or lack thereof):</b> Call progress
        involves the intelligent detection of telephony signals, such as busy signals, special
        instruction tones (SITs) and even signals from phone-line sharing devices and the sounds
        of human voices.<br>
        <br>
        Busy signal tones and cadences vary depending on whether they are generated by subscriber
        equipment (for example, a fax machine) or within a phone network (for example, all ports
        on a telephone company switch are temporarily busy) -- as well as from country to country.
        An example of special instruction tones (SITs) are the ever more frequent messages, on
        long-distance calls, informing callers that area code numbers have changed. High-quality
        call progress means that a fax device can detect all these different tones accurately. For
        example, if a fax device misreads an SIT tone as a busy tone, it will continue to re-try
        the transmission to the same fax number, even though the call cannot connect and the only
        result is inefficient use of fax server resources. Moreover, if the fax system then
        reports back to the system administrator that non-delivery of the fax was merely due to
        busy signals rather than the need to change the phone number, the number typically will be
        left intact and the fax system will end up trying and failing to connect to the same
        destination over and over again.<br>
        <br>
        The best intelligent fax boards support call progress for the full range of signals for
        all countries in which they are sold. In contrast, virtually all Class 1 and 2 fax modems
        and even some intelligent fax boards support more or less limited call progress. With
        low-end fax cards, the extent of call progress often comes down to recognizing US-based
        busy signals some of the time -- and defaulting to error reports like &quot;busy
        signal&quot; or &quot;non-fax device&quot; when they fail to detect the actual response
        signal.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Handshaking:</b> the sending fax device calls the
        receive-end device and they exchange signals (handshake) to determine which speed and
        compression methods the fax phone call will use (note that handshaking takes place at 300
        bps, regardless of how fast any modem can transmit). When fax designers built millisecond
        tolerances into the timing of fax machine and fax phone call operations back in the 1970s,
        they never guessed that computer fax systems would have to meet those timing requirements
        via modems operating through serial interfaces that had to relay interrupt signals to PC
        microprocessors that, as often as not, would already be busy handling computer-centric
        operations. Fax machines are hardwired to meet the very strict &quot;millisecond&quot;
        timing requirements of fax, so they virtually never have <i><b>&quot;time-out&quot;
        problems</b></i>. Class 1 fax modems, however, rely on general-purpose PC architectures
        and processing power to manage handshaking routines that can time-out if various
        sub-second timing requirements are not met. As a result, Class 1 devices will always be
        subject to high percentages of fax calls aborting due to time-out conditions. The
        microprocessors on intelligent fax boards make certain that time-outs are eliminated as a
        problem.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Page Transmission:</b> after handshaking, each page is
        transmitted at the highest compatible and achievable speed (for example., from 2.4 to 14.4
        Kbs) that both fax modems in a session can support. While products exist among all three
        types of fax cards that can transmit at 14.4 Kbs, <i><b>one of the little known secrets of
        fax technology is that other factors, led by compression and bit-stuffing, can have
        greater impact in reducing one's fax phone bill than actual transmission speed.</b></i><br>
        <br>
        Take the three levels of standardized fax compression. At 9.6 Kbs with a benchmark page,
        the Modified Huffman (MH) compression that is the best that Class 1 and 2 modems offer,
        supports 30-second/page throughput speed. In contrast, the Modified Read (MR) and Modified
        Modified Read (MMR) compression methods that intelligent fax boards and fax machines can
        offer support 20- and 10-second-per-page throughput speed, respectively (33% to 67%
        faster).<br>
        <br>
        One of the reasons advanced compression is so important to reducing fax phone bills is the
        make-up of the worldwide fax installed base of devices used to receive faxes. Davidson
        Consulting estimates that only about 10% are 14.4 Kbs devices (although they are
        high-volume devices that generate about 25% to 30% of overall fax traffic), while about
        70% -- generating about 85% of all fax traffic, support MR or MMR compression. Thus, the
        approximately 30% savings from 14.4 Kbs transmission speed occurs, on average, only in 1
        of every 3 or 4 calls. The 30% savings that MR provides over MH can be exploited on 8 or 9
        of every 10 calls. Although it is possible to implement advanced compression in software
        for use with Class 1 and 2 fax modems, like document conversion, the net result includes
        major slowdowns on the server PC. The impact of compression and other effects on fax phone
        call duration are listed in Table 2.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Retraining:</b> after each page is transmitted, the two
        fax devices resynchronize with each other (retrain) and, upon successfully doing so,
        transmit another page (then retrain, then transmit another page, and so on, until the call
        is completed). Notably, largely because of their relative cost structures and the
        resulting quality of components used on the cards, intelligent fax boards employ modems
        that send out stronger signals than Class 1 and 2 modems. The stronger signals handle
        phone line noise more effectively (for example, support a higher signal-to-noise ratio).
        Relative to retraining, the real-world result is that, whereas failures to retrain are
        rare among intelligent fax boards, they occur with significantly greater frequency with
        lower-cost fax modems. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In summary, intelligent fax boards save money in a number
    of ways: better compression cuts throughput time on most calls, efficient bit-stuffing
    eliminates unnecessary extensions to transmission time, stronger signals and higher
    quality call setup mean more calls are completed the first time and need not be
    retransmitted. </font><font size="1" face="Arial"><a href="#top"><br>

    Although the preceding information should make it clear that intelligent fax boards
    provide much better overall performance than Class 1 and 2 fax/data modems, that may not
    matter unless the superior performance translates into real-world cost-justification. In
    other words, since Class 1 and 2 modems tend to cost between $100 and $300 per board
    (port), while intelligent fax boards cost between $500 and $1,000 per port, the $400 to
    $900 extra for intelligent fax boards must be offset by reduced operating costs. To
    illustrate, we have created a return-on-investment model based on the following
    assumptions: </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">That the extra cost per port for an intelligent fax board
        compared to a Class 1 fax modem is the highest-possible $900 and over a Class 2 modem
        (with on-the-fly bit-stuffing) is $700<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">That a port is used to send just 40 4-page faxes per day
        (considered a mid-volume load), 260 days per year<br>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Of the 40 daily faxes, 10 are local (free), 25 long-distance

        rate for domestic calling and one dollar and higher rates for international calling that
        are sometimes used to make cost-justification appear more impressive<br>

        transmitted at various speeds and with various compression methods are quantified as
        follows: (1) 90% 9.6 Kbs and 10% 14.4% relative to transmission speed (instead of our
        actual estimate of 25% to 30% at 14.4) and (2) 30% MH, 60% MR and 10% MMR relative to
        compression support (instead of the estimates above that put MR and MMR combined at 85%
        overall)<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">That Class 1 fax modems do not bit-stuff on-the-fly, but
        Class 2 and intelligent fax boards do (and that bit-stuffing is unnecessary 75% of the

        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">That all other factors, including signal-to-noise ratio,
        unnecessarily prolonged handshaking and retraining, and the resending of failed call
        attempts add what we consider to be a very conservative 10% to Class 1 calling time and 5%
        to Class 2 calling time </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Using this model, intelligent fax boards pay off in less
    than a year, as shown in <a href="#table3"><b>Table 3</b></a>, and over the five-year life
    of a system save $6,460 versus Class 1 total cost of ownership and $3,685 versus Class 2
    total cost of ownership. Such savings are mid-volume, per port, and do not include the
    following: </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Server Savings:</b> Class 1 fax modems support merely one
        port per PC, period. If you need two ports, you must buy a second PC. Class 2 modems,
        because of the overhead associated with document conversion, can push the limit of PC
        server processing power with as few as two to four ports. In contrast, intelligent fax
        boards can support up to 96 ports per server. The upshot: past two to four ports, an <i><b>additional
        hidden cost of Class 2 ports can be the purchase of additional PCs.</b></i><br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>More 14.4 Kbs Faxing:</b> Where a fax system sends faxes
        to many 14.4 Kbs fax machines or intelligent fax boards, greater savings will accrue to a
        system based on intelligent fax boards because it can send at 14.4 Kbs coupled MMR
        compression (about 7-seconds-per-page), where Class 1 and 2 modems can only send at 14.4
        Kbs with MH compression (about 20-seconds-per-page). Even at 14.4 Kbs, Class 1 and 2 fax
        modems triple page transmission time!<br>
        <br>
        Indeed, if our ROI model assumptions are changed to reflect our estimates of actual levels
        of 14.4 Kbs usage (25% to 30%) and compression usage (15% MH, 60% MR and 25% MMR) relative
        to compression support (instead of the estimates above that put MR and MMR combined at 85%
        overall), intelligent fax board savings would be about 15% to 20% higher than those
        quantified in Table 3.<br>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>More Overseas Faxing:</b> Because overseas phone rates
        are higher, if one send more than 1 of every 8 faxes overseas, greater savings will result
        from intelligent fax board use than is shown in Table 3 above. Of course, due to time-zone
        differences, fax accounts for greater percentages of overseas than domestic calls.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Intangibles:</b> With intelligent fax boards, less labor
        is exerted to track down and handle failed call attempts. Productivity increases are
        greater because more people use intelligent fax board-based fax systems more often. Crises
        don't occur when workers arrive at the office in the morning to find that 70 faxes out of
        a 400-site fax broadcast were never actually sent. <br>
        </font><a href="#top"><font face="Arial" size="1">Back to the topics </font></a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><a name="how"></a>How to Buy Intelligent Fax Boards</b><br>
    <br>
    Considerations in the purchase of intelligent fax boards include: </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Compatibility:</b> Boards must be compatible with server
        operating systems, fax application software (for example., LAN fax, fax-on-demand),
        print-to-fax conversion methods, telephone network facilities (for example, analog loop
        start, T1, ISDN). Broad operating system support can be important to avoiding premature
        obsolescence. Support for T1 lines (and ISDN lines, particularly in Europe and Japan) can
        be crucial to generating the substantial savings that such bulk volume phone lines offer<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Throughput Speed:</b> Boards preferably should support
        14.4 Kbs transmission speed, MR and MMR compression as well as MH, and support both
        on-board on-the-fly document conversion and bit-stuffing. Whenever possible, buyers should
        test or otherwise determine the relative throughput speed of competing intelligent fax
        boards, as actual throughput can vary due a range of component and software level factors<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Call Progress:</b> Boards should provide very efficient
        call progress for as many signal types and countries as possible. It is very much worth
        analyzing how much poor call progress can reduce overall fax server throughput and
        contaminate fax broadcast lists and address books<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Computer Loading:</b> Buyers should test or otherwise
        determine the relative loading placed on server PCs, with an eye to how loading levels
        progress as more ports are added to a server.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Image Handling:</b> Can the fax device provide
        sophisticated and flexible handling of image files? For instance, can it support wide
        documents and business-form overlays on-the-fly? Does it support transmission of standard
        TIFF (Type F) files, in particular enabling it not to have to rely on PCX/DCX file
        formats, which can be much larger than TIFF files and prolong the duration of fax phone
        calls by a factor of two to ten? When used to receive faxes, can the fax device provide
        on-the-fly conversion of faxes received in MH or MR formats to the smaller and more
        efficiently stored and processed MMR format?<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Automated Processing of Received Faxes:</b> Particularly
        in LAN fax environments, buyers should consider the flexibility of using boards that can
        automatically route received faxes. While it may be significant for the fax device to
        support a technology like the ITU T.33 standard for subaddressing (which can automatically
        route faxes if transmitted from T.33-compatible devices; unfortunately, prior to mid-1996,
        no fax machines were T.33-compatible), the real issue is direct-inward-dial (DID) support.
        In North America, DID is the single type of inbound routing system that works with the
        entire worldwide fax machine installed base, works whether inbound faxes are manually or
        auto dialed, doesn't require that the person sending the fax enter some extra code or
        command, and doesn't require that routing clerks at the receive-end LAN laboriously open
        every received computer fax file, visually identify the recipient, and then route the fax
        to that person's fax mailbox. While DID requires special phone lines (sometimes available
        through one's PBX), by at least having DID implemented on fax devices, it saves the
        company the cost of buying external DID devices. Overseas, although DID-equivalent
        services (often abbreviated as DDI) are sometimes available, implementing equally viable
        and transparent inbound fax routing usually requires ISDN support. Again, having ISDN on
        the fax card eliminates the need to purchase third-party, external devices.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Programmability:</b> The API furnished with the
        intelligent fax board should be powerful, reliable, easy to use, and backwards- and
        forwards-compatible with other boards the vendor offers (and software that runs on the
        boards). Although there is a de facto standard fax programing interface, CAS, it is
        out-of-date and is a factor primarily in terms of supporting legacy applications with
        leading-edge intelligent fax boards. Because the API is the software &quot;window&quot;
        into the fax board's hardware functionality, its suitability is critical.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Patch, Fix and Upgradability:</b> It should be possible
        to fix and upgrade certain fax board capabilities with relative ease, which preferably
        means by simply downloading code and using it to update DSP-based functionality<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>System Integration Readiness:</b> How readily can the
        intelligent fax board be integrated with other, often telephony-based, systems? Can it
        support voice and fax on the same board? Does it support legacy integration interfaces
        like PEB and forward-moving architectures like MVIP and SCSA? Does it fully support key
        computer fax functions like DID and T.33 subaddressing and T.434 binary file transfer?<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Overseas Usage Approvals:</b> Where intelligent fax
        boards are to be used outside their country of manufacture, it is mandatory that
        manufacturers have received approval from the telecommunications authorities in each
        country. Moreover, it is not enough that the vendor has just any approval of a fax device
        in a specific country, it must have approvals for each separate model of fax device for
        each separate country.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Vendor Support:</b> How well can the vendor provide pre-
        and post-installation support? How effective is the documentation? Can the fax board
        vendor work closely with your software supplier and other players, like systems
        integrators? </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the end, the role that intelligent fax boards must
    fulfill for buyers is to enable the development of flexible and powerful fax applications
    and, once implemented, to support the fax calling process cost-effectively, reliably, and
    transparently. <br>
