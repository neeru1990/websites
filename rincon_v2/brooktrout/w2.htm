      <H5><B>Executive Summary</B></H5>
      <P>A myth exists that all fax boards and fax modems are essentially the 
        same. If they all send at 14.4 Kbs speed, then all fax phone bills are 
        the same and what else could matter? But fax technology can be surprising: 
        for example, even sending at 14.4 Kbs, Class 1 and 2 fax modems typically 
        triple page transmission time compared to intelligent fax board throughput!</P>
      <P>Three distinct types of fax cards exist: Class 1 fax modems, Class 2 
        fax modems, and intelligent fax boards, and each provides substantially 
        different levels of performance. In the mid-volume scenario presented 
        in this white paper, intelligent fax boards are shown to reduce life-of-system 
        fax phone bills by about $3,700 over Class 2 boards and by about $6,500 
        over Class 1 boards.</P>
      <P> The reasons why intelligent fax boards provide superior performance 
        may be obscure &#150; including Modified Modified Read compression, signal-to-noise 
        ratios, bit-stuffing, critical timing issues and call progress capabilities 
        &#150; but they are no less real to the bottom line for being esoteric. 
        This paper explains how fax boards differ, how those differences play 
        out according to fax phone call elements and installed base capabilities, 
        and why intelligent fax boards are a superior choice for virtually all 
        but the very lowest-volume computer fax applications.</P>
      <P> This paper also provides a checklist of items to consider when purchasing 
        intelligent fax boards.</P>
      <H5><A name="why"></A><B> Why to Buy Intelligent Fax Boards</B></H5>
      <P> In the glossy pages of the popular computer trade press, the &quot;fax 
        modem&quot; has been widely regarded as a commodity item, triggering the 
        widely held belief that all fax modems are the same. In fact, however, 
        vast disparities exist between the performance provided by low-cost fax/data 
        modems (for example, Class 1 and 2 devices) and intelligent fax boards 
        (fax cards with on-board microprocessors). Schooled largely by the trade 
        press, when equipping their LAN fax servers, fax-on-demand systems and 
        fax broadcasting engines with fax cards, businesses all too often choose 
        low-cost fax modems, a choice that typically saddles them with one or 
        more of the following problems: </P>
      <UL>
        <LI><B>Dollar Drain:</B> Just about every fax phone call made with low-cost 
          fax modems costs about twice as much as necessary in usage charges paid 
          to one's telephone company (and it can literally be ten times as much!). 
          This is a critical issue because over the life of a fax system, the 
          &quot;pennies&quot; paid for thousands of fax calls tend to add up to 
          far more than the original purchase price.</LI>
        <LI><B>Hassle:</B> Headaches arise from unnecessarily high percentages 
          of fax phone calls never being completed by low-cost fax modems, particularly 
          with Class 1 devices.</LI>
        <LI><B>Disinterest:</B> A fall-off occurs in computer fax system usage 
          by workers due to the unreliability of the low-cost fax modems on which 
          the system is based.</LI>
        <LI><B>Quick System Max-Out:</B> Low-cost modems fail to support adequate 
          system scalability because they require general-purpose PCs to struggle 
          to muster enough power, quickly enough, to manage the multi-channel 
          faxing that intelligent fax boards support with ease. When businesses 
          commit to systems using fax cards that don't scale up well, one result 
          can be the needless expense of an extra PC for every couple of ports 
          (instead, for example, of one PC supporting 24 or 48 ports).</LI>
        <LI><B>Languishing Labor:</B> When low-cost modems are installed on personal 
          PCs, a hidden toll is extracted from users who are forced to sit idly 
          while under-powered fax modems demand full PC microprocessor attention. 
        </LI>
      </UL>
      <H5><A name="intelligence"></A><B>Intelligence Report: Differentiating Fax 
        Cards</B></H5>
      <P> The three types of fax cards are Class 1 modems, Class 2 modems, and 
        intelligent fax boards: </P>
      <UL>
        <LI><B>Class 1</B> fax modems (EIA 578) comprise the lowest-cost category 
          for a very simple reason: they rely totally on the power of PC microprocessors 
          for tasks critical to sending faxes, including the conversion of PC 
          files to fax format, support for bit-stuffing (bit-stuffing is explained 
          below), and management of the fax phone call itself, including all signaling 
          to set up and maintain a fax call. They support fast transmission speed 
          (14.4 Kbs), but only the slowest form of standard fax compression.</LI>
        <LI><B>Class 2</B> fax modems, like their Class 1 cousins, rely on the 
          power of PC microprocessors to convert PC files to fax format, but handle 
          all signaling to set up and maintain fax calls via on-board circuitry. 
          They may handle bit stuffing on-board or via the PC microprocessor, 
          but support only low level fax compression. Note that there are both 
          Class 2 and 2.0 fax modems: (1) Class 2 modems are based on a de facto 
          standard [a proposed standard that was voted down &#150; but manufacturers 
          produced modems Class 2 modems anyway, resulting in many &quot;flavors&quot; 
          of Class 2 modems]; millions of Class 2 modems are installed; while 
          some bit-stuff on-the-fly, many do not; (2) Class 2.0 fax modems, which 
          comply with the official EIA 592 standard, handle bit-stuffing on-the-fly; 
          but Davidson Consulting was aware of only three Class 2.0-compatible 
          devices on the market a full two years after the 2.0 standard was approved.</LI>
        <LI><B>Intelligent Fax Boards</B> differentiate themselves via on-board 
          microprocessors which, in addition to sending faxes at 14.4 Kbs speed, 
          also can support advanced fax compression methods, convert documents 
          to fax format and bit-stuff on-the-fly on the board (not on the PC), 
          and can manage fax phone calls via on-board processing power.</LI>
      </UL>
      <P>Intelligent fax boards carry the highest price tags, which is why buyers 
        naturally flock to the lower-cost &quot;class&quot; modems. But they save 
        far, far more than the differential in cost by more reliably completing 
        calls (see <A
    href="#table1"><B>Table 1</B></A>), sending faxes in less time to reduce fax 
        phone bills (see <A href="#table2"><B>Table 2</B></A>), by minimizing 
        maintenance issues, by providing strong enough performance that people 
        actually use the computer fax systems based on them, and by cost-effectively 
        exploiting server resources.</P>
      <H5> <B>Are You Bit-Stuffing Your Fax Phone Bill?</B></H5>
      <P> Bit stuffing is required because, with many older non-memory fax machines, 
        the code sent to describe a fax scan line transmits than the time it takes 
        the printhead to move across the page. The solution is to stuff extra 
        bits into the code to keep the mechanical parts synchronized. The receive-end 
        fax machine invokes the need for bit-stuffing and, if the sending device 
        cannot bit stuff, the fax call aborts. The best way to bit-stuff is dynamically, 
        on-the-fly, via an on-board microprocessor. This ways, fax phone call 
        time is extended for bit stuffing only when called for and only to the 
        extent necessary. The alternative is to pre-stuff every file to be computer 
        faxed, but this means that every fax phone call lasts longer and that 
        more bits than necessary must be stuffed. Assuming that only 10% to 25% 
        of the worldwide fax installed base actually requires bit stuffing, then 
        pre-storing unnecessarily extends 75% to 90% of calls, typically by about 
        40%, give or take. </P>

                poor call progress monitoring, the results include (1) instead

      <H5> <A name="anatomy"></A><B>Anatomy of a Fax Phone Call</B></H5>
      A great deal of the difference in modem types can be illustrated by examining 
      the elements of a fax phone call: 
      <UL>
        <LI><B>Document Conversion:</B> computer files must be converted from 
          original formats to the G/3 fax format (for example, a TIFF file). Document 
          conversion is about 10 to 20 times more processing-intensive than managing 
          the actual fax phone call. <I><B>Both Class 1 and 2 fax modems place 
          the document conversion burden -- which is the primary bottleneck area 
          in a computer fax system -- on the PC, not on themselves.</B></I> This 
          either substantially reduces the volume of traffic that any fax server 
          can support or interferes with the ability of individual users to use 
          their fax-enabled PCs while documents are being converted. Intelligent 
          fax boards can handle document conversion on-board on-the-fly, freeing 
          PC resources so a fax server can support greater volume or so end users 
          need not sit idly at their PCs during fax phone call preparation time. 
          They may also support on-the-fly enhancements to images, such as automatically 
          superimposing business-form designs onto raw data (called business-form 
          overlay) and scaling document sizes to fit the need of receive-end fax 
          machines (for example, from the letter size used in the US to the B4 
          paper size used in Japan).<BR>
          <BR>
        </LI>
        <LI><B>Call Progress (or lack thereof):</B> Call progress involves the 
          intelligent detection of telephony signals, such as busy signals, special 
          instruction tones (SITs) and even signals from phone-line sharing devices 
          and the sounds of human voices. Busy signal tones and cadences vary 
          depending on whether they are generated by subscriber equipment (for 
          example, a fax machine) or within a phone network (for example, all 
          ports on a telephone company switch are temporarily busy) -- as well 
          as from country to country. An example of special instruction tones 
          (SITs) are the ever more frequent messages, on long-distance calls, 
          informing callers that area code numbers have changed. High-quality 
          call progress means that a fax device can detect all these different 
          tones accurately. For example, if a fax device misreads an SIT tone 
          as a busy tone, it will continue to re-try the transmission to the same 
          fax number, even though the call cannot connect and the only result 
          is inefficient use of fax server resources. Moreover, if the fax system 
          then reports back to the system administrator that non-delivery of the 
          fax was merely due to busy signals rather than the need to change the 
          phone number, the number typically will be left intact and the fax system 
          will end up trying and failing to connect to the same destination over 
          and over again. The best intelligent fax boards support call progress 
          for the full range of signals for all countries in which they are sold. 
          In contrast, virtually all Class 1 and 2 fax modems and even some intelligent 
          fax boards support more or less limited call progress. With low-end 
          fax cards, the extent of call progress often comes down to recognizing 
          US-based busy signals some of the time -- and defaulting to error reports 
          like &quot;busy signal&quot; or &quot;non-fax device&quot; when they 
          fail to detect the actual response signal.<BR>
          <BR>
        </LI>
        <LI><B>Handshaking:</B> the sending fax device calls the receive-end device 
          and they exchange signals (handshake) to determine which speed and compression 
          methods the fax phone call will use (note that handshaking takes place 
          at 300 bps, regardless of how fast any modem can transmit). When fax 
          designers built millisecond tolerances into the timing of fax machine 
          and fax phone call operations back in the 1970s, they never guessed 
          that computer fax systems would have to meet those timing requirements 
          via modems operating through serial interfaces that had to relay interrupt 
          signals to PC microprocessors that, as often as not, would already be 
          busy handling computer-centric operations. Fax machines are hardwired 
          to meet the very strict &quot;millisecond&quot; timing requirements 
          of fax, so they virtually never have <I><B>&quot;time-out&quot; problems</B></I>. 
          Class 1 fax modems, however, rely on general-purpose PC architectures 
          and processing power to manage handshaking routines that can time-out 
          if various sub-second timing requirements are not met. As a result, 
          Class 1 devices will always be subject to high percentages of fax calls 
          aborting due to time-out conditions. The microprocessors on intelligent 
          fax boards make certain that time-outs are eliminated as a problem.<BR>
          <BR>
        </LI>
        <LI><B>Page Transmission:</B> after handshaking, each page is transmitted 
          at the highest compatible and achievable speed (for example., from 2.4 
          to 14.4 Kbs) that both fax modems in a session can support. While products 
          exist among all three types of fax cards that can transmit at 14.4 Kbs, 
          <I><B>one of the little known secrets of fax technology is that other 
          factors, led by compression and bit-stuffing, can have greater impact 
          in reducing one's fax phone bill than actual transmission speed.</B></I> 
          Take the three levels of standardized fax compression. At 9.6 Kbs with 
          a benchmark page, the Modified Huffman (MH) compression that is the 
          best that Class 1 and 2 modems offer, supports 30-second/page throughput 
          speed. In contrast, the Modified Read (MR) and Modified Modified Read 
          (MMR) compression methods that intelligent fax boards and fax machines 
          can offer support 20- and 10-second-per-page throughput speed, respectively 
          (33% to 67% faster). One of the reasons advanced compression is so important 
          to reducing fax phone bills is the make-up of the worldwide fax installed 
          base of devices used to receive faxes. Davidson Consulting estimates 
          that only about 10% are 14.4 Kbs devices (although they are high-volume 
          devices that generate about 25% to 30% of overall fax traffic), while 
          about 70% -- generating about 85% of all fax traffic, support MR or 
          MMR compression. Thus, the approximately 30% savings from 14.4 Kbs transmission 
          speed occurs, on average, only in 1 of every 3 or 4 calls. The 30% savings 
          that MR provides over MH can be exploited on 8 or 9 of every 10 calls. 
          Although it is possible to implement advanced compression in software 
          for use with Class 1 and 2 fax modems, like document conversion, the 
          net result includes major slowdowns on the server PC. The impact of 
          compression and other effects on fax phone call duration are listed 
          in Table 2.<BR>
          <BR>
        </LI>
        <LI><B>Retraining:</B> after each page is transmitted, the two fax devices 
          resynchronize with each other (retrain) and, upon successfully doing 
          so, transmit another page (then retrain, then transmit another page, 
          and so on, until the call is completed). Notably, largely because of 
          their relative cost structures and the resulting quality of components 
          used on the cards, intelligent fax boards employ modems that send out 
          stronger signals than Class 1 and 2 modems. The stronger signals handle 
          phone line noise more effectively (for example, support a higher signal-to-noise 
          ratio). Relative to retraining, the real-world result is that, whereas 
          failures to retrain are rare among intelligent fax boards, they occur 
          with significantly greater frequency with lower-cost fax modems. </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>In summary, intelligent fax boards save money in a number of ways: better 
        compression cuts throughput time on most calls, efficient bit-stuffing 
        eliminates unnecessary extensions to transmission time, stronger signals 
        and higher quality call setup mean more calls are completed the first 
        time and need not be retransmitted. </P>

      <P> Although the preceding information should make it clear that intelligent 
        fax boards provide much better overall performance than Class 1 and 2 
        fax/data modems, that may not matter unless the superior performance translates 
        into real-world cost-justification. In other words, since Class 1 and 
        2 modems tend to cost between $100 and $300 per board (port), while intelligent 
        fax boards cost between $500 and $1,000 per port, the $400 to $900 extra 
        for intelligent fax boards must be offset by reduced operating costs. 
        To illustrate, we have created a return-on-investment model based on the 
        following assumptions: </P>
      <UL>
        <LI>That the extra cost per port for an intelligent fax board compared 
          to a Class 1 fax modem is the highest-possible $900 and over a Class 
          2 modem (with on-the-fly bit-stuffing) is $700</LI>
        <LI>That a port is used to send just 40 4-page faxes per day (considered 
          a mid-volume load), 260 days per year</LI>
        <LI>Of the 40 daily faxes, 10 are local (free), 25 long-distance (12-cents/minute) 
          and 5 overseas (50-cents/minute). Note that we are not using the 25-cent 
          rate for domestic calling and one dollar and higher rates for international 
          calling that are sometimes used to make cost-justification appear more 
          impressive</LI>
        <LI>That traffic patterns are more conservatively stated than estimates 
          made above, by which we mean that assumptions of the percentages of 
          faxes transmitted at various speeds and with various compression methods 
          are quantified as follows: (1) 90% 9.6 Kbs and 10% 14.4% relative to 
          transmission speed (instead of our actual estimate of 25% to 30% at 
          14.4) and (2) 30% MH, 60% MR and 10% MMR relative to compression support 
          (instead of the estimates above that put MR and MMR combined at 85% 
          overall)</LI>
        <LI>That Class 1 fax modems do not bit-stuff on-the-fly, but Class 2 and 
          intelligent fax boards do (and that bit-stuffing is unnecessary 75% 
          of the time)</LI>
        <LI>That all other factors, including signal-to-noise ratio, unnecessarily 
          prolonged handshaking and retraining, and the resending of failed call 
          attempts add what we consider to be a very conservative 10% to Class 
          1 calling time and 5% to Class 2 calling time </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>Using this model, intelligent fax boards pay off in less than a year, 
        as shown in <A href="#table3"><B>Table 3</B></A>, and over the five-year 
        life of a system save $6,460 versus Class 1 total cost of ownership and 
        $3,685 versus Class 2 total cost of ownership. Such savings are mid-volume, 
        per port, and do not include the following: </P>
      <UL>
        <LI><B>Server Savings:</B> Class 1 fax modems support merely one port 
          per PC, period. If you need two ports, you must buy a second PC. Class 
          2 modems, because of the overhead associated with document conversion, 
          can push the limit of PC server processing power with as few as two 
          to four ports. In contrast, intelligent fax boards can support up to 
          96 ports per server. The upshot: past two to four ports, an <I><B>additional 
          hidden cost of Class 2 ports can be the purchase of additional PCs.</B></I></LI>
        <LI><B>More 14.4 Kbs Faxing:</B> Where a fax system sends faxes to many 
          14.4 Kbs fax machines or intelligent fax boards, greater savings will 
          accrue to a system based on intelligent fax boards because it can send 
          at 14.4 Kbs coupled MMR compression (about 7-seconds-per-page), where 
          Class 1 and 2 modems can only send at 14.4 Kbs with MH compression (about 
          20-seconds-per-page). Even at 14.4 Kbs, Class 1 and 2 fax modems triple 
          page transmission time! Indeed, if our ROI model assumptions are changed 
          to reflect our estimates of actual levels of 14.4 Kbs usage (25% to 
          30%) and compression usage (15% MH, 60% MR and 25% MMR) relative to 
          compression support (instead of the estimates above that put MR and 
          MMR combined at 85% overall), intelligent fax board savings would be 
          about 15% to 20% higher than those quantified in Table 3.</LI>

      <UL>
        <LI><B>More Overseas Faxing:</B> Because overseas phone rates are higher, 
          if one send more than 1 of every 8 faxes overseas, greater savings will 
          result from intelligent fax board use than is shown in Table 3 above. 
          Of course, due to time-zone differences, fax accounts for greater percentages 
          of overseas than domestic calls.</LI>
        <LI><B>Intangibles:</B> With intelligent fax boards, less labor is exerted 
          to track down and handle failed call attempts. Productivity increases 
          are greater because more people use intelligent fax board-based fax 
          systems more often. Crises don't occur when workers arrive at the office 
          in the morning to find that 70 faxes out of a 400-site fax broadcast 
          were never actually sent. </LI>
      </UL>
      <H5><B><A name="how"></A>How to Buy Intelligent Fax Boards</B></H5>
      Considerations in the purchase of intelligent fax boards include: 
      <UL>
        <LI><B>Compatibility:</B> Boards must be compatible with server operating 
          systems, fax application software (for example., LAN fax, fax-on-demand), 
          print-to-fax conversion methods, telephone network facilities (for example, 
          analog loop start, T1, ISDN). Broad operating system support can be 
          important to avoiding premature obsolescence. Support for T1 lines (and 
          ISDN lines, particularly in Europe and Japan) can be crucial to generating 
          the substantial savings that such bulk volume phone lines offer</LI>
        <LI><B>Throughput Speed:</B> Boards preferably should support 14.4 Kbs 
          transmission speed, MR and MMR compression as well as MH, and support 
          both on-board on-the-fly document conversion and bit-stuffing. Whenever 
          possible, buyers should test or otherwise determine the relative throughput 
          speed of competing intelligent fax boards, as actual throughput can 
          vary due a range of component and software level factors</LI>
        <LI><B>Call Progress:</B> Boards should provide very efficient call progress 
          for as many signal types and countries as possible. It is very much 
          worth analyzing how much poor call progress can reduce overall fax server 
          throughput and contaminate fax broadcast lists and address books</LI>
        <LI><B>Computer Loading:</B> Buyers should test or otherwise determine 
          the relative loading placed on server PCs, with an eye to how loading 
          levels progress as more ports are added to a server.</LI>
        <LI><B>Image Handling:</B> Can the fax device provide sophisticated and 
          flexible handling of image files? For instance, can it support wide 
          documents and business-form overlays on-the-fly? Does it support transmission 
          of standard TIFF (Type F) files, in particular enabling it not to have 
          to rely on PCX/DCX file formats, which can be much larger than TIFF 
          files and prolong the duration of fax phone calls by a factor of two 
          to ten? When used to receive faxes, can the fax device provide on-the-fly 
          conversion of faxes received in MH or MR formats to the smaller and 
          more efficiently stored and processed MMR format?</LI>
        <LI><B>Automated Processing of Received Faxes:</B> Particularly in LAN 
          fax environments, buyers should consider the flexibility of using boards 
          that can automatically route received faxes. While it may be significant 
          for the fax device to support a technology like the ITU T.33 standard 
          for subaddressing (which can automatically route faxes if transmitted 
          from T.33-compatible devices; unfortunately, prior to mid-1996, no fax 
          machines were T.33-compatible), the real issue is direct-inward-dial 
          (DID) support. In North America, DID is the single type of inbound routing 
          system that works with the entire worldwide fax machine installed base, 
          works whether inbound faxes are manually or auto dialed, doesn't require 
          that the person sending the fax enter some extra code or command, and 
          doesn't require that routing clerks at the receive-end LAN laboriously 
          open every received computer fax file, visually identify the recipient, 
          and then route the fax to that person's fax mailbox. While DID requires 
          special phone lines (sometimes available through one's PBX), by at least 
          having DID implemented on fax devices, it saves the company the cost 
          of buying external DID devices. Overseas, although DID-equivalent services 
          (often abbreviated as DDI) are sometimes available, implementing equally 
          viable and transparent inbound fax routing usually requires ISDN support. 
          Again, having ISDN on the fax card eliminates the need to purchase third-party, 
          external devices.</LI>
        <LI><B>Programmability:</B> The API furnished with the intelligent fax 
          board should be powerful, reliable, easy to use, and backwards- and 
          forwards-compatible with other boards the vendor offers (and software 
          that runs on the boards). Although there is a de facto standard fax 
          programing interface, CAS, it is out-of-date and is a factor primarily 
          in terms of supporting legacy applications with leading-edge intelligent 
          fax boards. Because the API is the software &quot;window&quot; into 
          the fax board's hardware functionality, its suitability is critical.</LI>
        <LI><B>Patch, Fix and Upgradability:</B> It should be possible to fix 
          and upgrade certain fax board capabilities with relative ease, which 
          preferably means by simply downloading code and using it to update DSP-based 
          functionality</LI>
        <LI><B>System Integration Readiness:</B> How readily can the intelligent 
          fax board be integrated with other, often telephony-based, systems? 
          Can it support voice and fax on the same board? Does it support legacy 
          integration interfaces like PEB and forward-moving architectures like 
          MVIP and SCSA? Does it fully support key computer fax functions like 
          DID and T.33 subaddressing and T.434 binary file transfer?</LI>
        <LI><B>Overseas Usage Approvals:</B> Where intelligent fax boards are 
          to be used outside their country of manufacture, it is mandatory that 
          manufacturers have received approval from the telecommunications authorities 
          in each country. Moreover, it is not enough that the vendor has just 
          any approval of a fax device in a specific country, it must have approvals 
          for each separate model of fax device for each separate country.</LI>
        <LI><B>Vendor Support:</B> How well can the vendor provide pre- and post-installation 
          support? How effective is the documentation? Can the fax board vendor 
          work closely with your software supplier and other players, like systems 
          integrators? </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>In the end, the role that intelligent fax boards must fulfill for buyers 
        is to enable the development of flexible and powerful fax applications 
        and, once implemented, to support the fax calling process cost-effectively, 
        reliably, and transparently. </P>
