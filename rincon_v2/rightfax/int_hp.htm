      <H2>Hewlett Packard Integration FAQ</H2>
      <P> <STRONG>Q. How does RightFax work with the HP 9100C and 8100C Digital 
        Sender? </STRONG><BR>
        A. Users can easily scan documents into the RightFax server and manage 
        the documents to send, store, copy and route using the RightFax interface. 
        With the integration of RightFax and the HP 9100C and 8100C Digital Sender, 
        fax numbers can be entered directly on the control panel of the scanner. 
        The document can also be scanned via the HP 9100C and 8100C Digital Sender 
        directly to a network file server, either NetWare&reg; or Windows NT&reg;. 
        The document is then sent to a user&#8217;s PC desktop and faxed from 
        there using the RightFax server. </P>
      <P><STRONG>Q. How is a fax sent from the HP 9100C and 8100C?<BR>
        </STRONG>A. The user simply places the document in the scanner and enters 
        the fax number into the control panel or selects a fax number from a predefined 
        list of destinations. The document is then scanned and sent directly to 
        the RightFax server for transmission. A copy of the fax is stored in the 
        user&#8217;s RightFax mailbox. </P>
      <P>The user can scan the document and type in the name/number of the mailbox. 
        From there the documents can be distributed electronically within the 
        immediate company or to remote locations such as branch offices or main 
        headquarters via the RightFax network fax server. The scanned document 
        can be combined with other scanned documents or with documents from other 
        application such as Microsoft&reg; Word or Excel. </P>
