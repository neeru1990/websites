      <H2>Lotus Integration FAQ</H2>
      <P> <STRONG>Q. What is the RightFax Gateway for Lotus Notes?<BR>
        </STRONG>A. The RightFax Gateway for Lotus Notes is an optional module 
        that links Lotus Notes with RightFax desktop fax features, creating a 
        fully unified fax and email solution. The gateway uses RightFax to enable 
        inbound and outbound faxing directly from the Notes client. Notes users 
        need virtually no training to send and receive faxes, because they&#8217;ll 
        use Notes in the same way they would send and receive emails. Database 
        synchronization between Lotus Notes/Domino and RightFax allows unified 
        administration of both servers. </P>
      <P><STRONG>Q. How does the Gateway for Lotus Notes work?<BR>
        </STRONG>A. RightFax makes sending and receiving fax documents as simple 
        for users as using Notes mail. Faxes can be addressed to one or more destinations, 
        including mixed fax and email addresses, using a simple dialog. Advanced 
        fax functionality is available to expand and simplify the process of sending 
        faxes via Notes, all without modifications to the Notes mail template. 
        Giving users tools to work within their familiar Notes environment reduces 
        training time and streamlines communications processes. </P>
      <P>When a user faxes a document from Notes, the gateway delivers the document 
        to the RightFax server. RightFax renders the document to fax format, including 
        several native file types, adds a cover sheet or any specified library 
        document, and then transmits the document. The RightFax Gateway for Lotus 
        Notes also automatically routes incoming faxes as mail messages to Notes 
        mail databases. </P>
      <P><STRONG>Q: How does a user send and receive fax documents?<BR>
        </STRONG>RightFax makes sending and receiving fax documents as simple

        including mixed fax and email addresses, using a simple dialog. Advanced

      <P>When a user faxes a document from Notes, the gateway delivers the document 
        to the RightFax server. RightFax renders the document to fax format, including 
        several native file types, adds a cover sheet or any specified library 
        document, and then transmits the document over phone lines, an intranet 
        or the Internet. </P>
      <P>The RightFax Gateway for Lotus Notes also automatically routes incoming 
        faxes as mail messages to Notes mail databases. Custom icons let users 
        easily identify draft, sent, and received fax messages in their Notes 
        mail. The fax image itself is saved as a file attachment in a Notes mail 
        message. To view the fax, the user simply double-clicks the attachment 
        icon. </P>
      <P><STRONG>Q. How does administration of the Gateway work?<BR>
        </STRONG>A. RightFax offers the most sophisticated integration with Lotus 
        Notes, providing Notes administrators with a comprehensive feature set 
        that lets users perform virtually every fax function from the familiar 
        Notes mail interface. Since the gateway is installed at the server, there 
        is no need to install additional software on each desktop and no need 
        for additional training. </P>
      <P>For Notes administrators, RightFax boasts native Notes installation and 
        on-demand synchronization. Providing complete administrative autonomy, 
        RightFax allows Notes administrators to access and modify RightFax settings 
        and configuration options from directly within Notes. With this built-in 
        efficiency, fax administration becomes effortless. </P>
