      <H2>Enterprise &amp; Network Fax</H2>
      <P>Fax technology is as vital a part of business-to-business communications 
        as the telephone and electricity are part of our everyday lives. With 
        its ease of use, immediacy of delivery and universal accessibility, fax 
        has earned worldwide acceptance. Fax is no longer considered a convenience, 
        but rather integral to doing business. And Captaris RightFax is the worldwide 
        choice. As fax technology evolves into total e-document delivery, RightFax 
        remains at the forefront.</P>
      <H5> Putting You in Control of Electronic Document Delivery </H5>
      <P>RightFax delivers critical business documents where you want, when you 
        want. Reliably. Economically. Securely. In today&#8217;s fast-paced, wired

      <P>RightFax solutions provide companies with a centralized infrastructure

        can be assured of higher reliability and lower cost of ownership. Certification 
        ensures that applications meet all the requirements of the Microsoft Application 
        Specification for Windows 2000. The end result is an application that 
        is easier to install, maintain, and manage. Although thousands of applications 
        are fully compatible with Microsoft operating systems, only select vendors 
        like Captaris have elected to have their application rigorously tested 
        against the exacting set of standards set by Microsoft to ensure that 
        they are secure, manageable and run reliably in these environments. </P>
