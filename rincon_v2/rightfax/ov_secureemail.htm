      <P>With SecureDocs, users can send documents securely from their Windows 
        desktop, from the RightFax FaxUtil client, or from their accounting, mainframe, 
        ERP or host system using the RightFax InternetLink Module. The document 
        is digitally encrypted and password protected so that documents can be 
        delivered electronically without worry of tampering. In addition, SecureDocs 
        can also provide certified delivery, which ensures notification of its 
        receipt. Using certified delivery, the documents are delivered as a message 
        to the recipient&#8217;s mailbox, and posted on a Web site. The recipient 
        can retrieve the password protected document on the Web site using a standard 
        Web browser. A confirmation with the date and time the document was opened
