            Segasys' strategy defines a successful project simply as one that 
            meets quality, schedule and budget requirements. Our development methodology 
            is built upon meeting the explicit and implicit needs of our design 
            and development team, our clients, their customers, their investors 
            and others. Following this methodology, allows us to thoroughly and 
            systematically identify our clients' requirements, produce a product 
            design and then implement and test the design for a timely final release.</STRONG></FONT><BR>
